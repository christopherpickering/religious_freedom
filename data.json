A government directive restricts monks from participating in political protests and requires them to be politically neutral.\n\nAccording to human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the Ministry of Cults and Religions (MCR), continued to exercise control in determining leadership positions for the country\u2019s primary Buddhist and Muslim organizations. The government increased the number of Muslims it appointed to leadership roles in local government in areas serving significant Muslim populations and expanded access to halal products made in the country. The MCR continued to consider draft legislation that would impose criminal sanctions on \u201creligious people\u201d for participating in political acts. The government increased efforts to register collective land for Indigenous communities who consider the forest sacred, although Indigenous leaders said the pace remained slow. The government provided funds for Buddhist training and education to monks and laypersons in pagodas, but not to other religious groups. There were cases in which Buddhist leaders defrocked monks for expressing criticism of then Prime Minister (PM) Hun Sen and aligning with an opposition political party. Defrocked Buddhist monk Voeung Samnang continued serving a five-year prison sentence for conspiracy to commit treason and incitement to commit a felony or cause social unrest, stemming from political social media postings.\n\nIndigenous community leaders stated that local businesspeople, in collusion with local authorities, encroached on ancestral land. Muslim Cham community leaders said that Cham continued to have equal employment and educational opportunities. In August, the Catholic Church ordained the first Cambodian priest from the Jesuit order in the country.\n\nThe Ambassador and U.S. embassy officials met with government officials to promote religious freedom and the importance of fully integrating religious minorities into society and to highlight the benefits of respecting the country\u2019s religious pluralism. The Ambassador and embassy officials visited religious sites and also discussed religious freedom with Buddhist, Christian, and Muslim leaders, and other minority religious groups \u2013 including Indigenous peoples practicing animist religions. The embassy increased recruitment efforts from religious minority communities and other underrepresented groups for staff positions and embassy programs. The Ambassador used social media platforms to promote tolerance for different religious practices in the country. To document religious persecution by the Khmer Rouge regime, the embassy continued to fund transitional justice programs that engaged the Cham Muslim community.",

This marked a deviation from the norm, as previously revocations had only been ordered following violations of criminal law, while this dissolution was ordered on the basis of violation of civil law.  MEXT Minister Moriyama Masahito said the church had systemically violated civil law, alleging it used its religious organization status to encourage members to make donations and expensive purchases that harmed public welfare and deviated from its original purpose since 1980.

Due to this exclusion, many domestic workers continued to be unable to attend religious services.  According to the Ministry of Labor (MOL), none of the 17 cases reported to the ministry between January and September by caregivers and household workers whose employers denied them a weekly rest day specifically referenced the inability to attend religious services.  The MOL continued to coordinate with the Ministry of Health and Welfare to expand subsidized, short-term respite care services for employers, thereby enabling more caregivers to take leave to attend religious services without risking their employment, and in January instituted an additional short-term substitute care program.  The MOL educated employers via traditional and new media during the year on the importance migrant employees place on attending religious services.  Multiple religious groups called on authorities to promote more actively the available subsidized respite care services and educate employers about migrant domestic workers\u2019 rights, including respect for their religious needs.

The Directorate of Religious Affairs (DRA) created the Interreligious Humanitarian Network to respond to humanitarian crises and also created the Interreligious Rural Network to strengthen the MOI\u2019s institutional relationship with religious organizations to maintain peace and freedom of religion and belief in rural conflict areas. President Petro posted on social media numerous times following the Hamas October 7 terrorist attack on Israel, comparing the Israeli response to the Nazi regime. The Confederation of Jewish Communities of Colombia (CJCC) denounced the postings.\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Office (AGO) reported that nonstate actors killed four religious leaders during the year, compared with three in 2022. In addition, the office investigated two cases of forced displacement of religious leaders in Putumayo and an unknown location. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and church representatives reported illegal armed groups continued to kill, threaten, or displace human rights defenders, including some religious leaders, for promoting human rights, supporting internally displaced persons, assisting with land restitution claims, and discouraging coca cultivation. Leaders of many religious groups continued to report that illegal, armed nonstate groups, in particular the U.S.-designated terrorist organization the National Liberation Army (ELN), hindered peace and reconciliation programs and at times sought monthly extortion payments in rural areas.\n\nThe government reported two criminal investigations were underway for damage or injury to individuals or places of worship in Medellin and Nechi at the end of the year. Following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and the Israeli military response, the CJCC reported an increase in antisemitic comments and calls for expulsion of Jews via social media. In October, two individuals attempted to break into the Abou Bakr Alsiddiq Mosque, and according to witnesses, the perpetrators demanded Muslims leave the country. The Catholic Church, Mennonite Church, and other religious groups continued to conduct programs focused on religious tolerance, land rights, peace, and reconciliation. Throughout the year, the Catholic Church served as a prominent mediator in peace talks between the government and certain illegal armed groups, including the ELN. Faith-based and interfaith NGOs continued to promote religious freedom and tolerance through their programs and community engagement.\n\nU.S. embassy officials discussed with members of the DRA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Human Rights Directorate, the Ministry of Defense\u2019s (MOD) Human Rights Directorate, and the AGO the government\u2019s policies on religious freedom, including antisemitism. In May, a senior embassy official delivered remarks at an event focusing on the important role of religious leaders in advocating religious freedom and other human rights. The U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism publicly condemned President Petro\u2019s statements that likened Israel\u2019s response to the attacks by Hamas to actions of the Nazi regime. The Special Envoy described the statements as antisemitic rhetoric, consistent with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance working definition of antisemitism.",

The law does not provide a means for religious groups to acquire legal status.\n\nIn March, the government submitted to the national legislature proposed amendments to the law on religious freedom that would allow religious groups to gain legal status; the Assembly (national legislature) took no action on them during the year.  In May, police again prevented clergy from the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC) from performing a service in the contested Christ the Savior Church in Pristina.  Some schools continued to deny access to Muslim girls wearing hijabs, citing government regulations.  Municipal and central government officials again failed to implement earlier Constitutional Court and Supreme Court rulings recognizing the SOC\u2019s Visoki Decani Monastery\u2019s ownership of land near the monastery.  In May, President Vjosa Osmani said that enforcing the courts\u2019 earlier decisions regarding the disputed monastery property \u201ccould create an extremely dangerous precedent.\u201d  In October, the government deported a member of the SOC clergy to North Macedonia for unspecified violations of the Law on Foreigners.  The SOC said the deportation was a \u201cbrutal, arbitrary, and extrajudicial expulsion.\u201d  In July, Prime Minister Albin Kurti posted on social media that Serbia was using ambulances to \u201csmuggle arms into Orthodox churches in Kosovo.\u201d  The SOC said Kurti\u2019s statements \u201copenly incited ethnic and religious intolerance.\u201d\n\nIn September, an armed group of ethnic Serbs attacked Kosovo Police in Banjska, Zvecan municipality, killing one police officer and injuring two others.  After attacking the police, the group forcibly entered the nearby SOC Banjska Monastery and fought police from there for hours before escaping.  Police reported three assailants were killed during the skirmish.  The SOC condemned the attack and complained about public statements from government officials, public figures, and media alleging SOC complicity.\n\nIn February, four individuals prevented an imam from performing religious rites at the Halabak mosque in Podujeva/o municipality and assaulted one person from the congregation.  In April, a group of unidentified individuals assaulted the imam of Miradi e Eperme/Gornje Dobrevo village in Fushe Kosova/Kosovo Polje after daily prayers.  Jewish community representatives noted a significant increase in antisemitic language in social media following the Hamas attack in Israel in October, but the head of the community said \u201cfake news\u201d was sometimes the cause.  The SOC stated some of the incidents targeting its property, including one during the Orthodox Easter holidays, were religiously and ethnically motivated.  The SOC said police failed to act on or were unwilling to act on criminal offenses \u201cwith a religious or nationalist background.\u201d  Police representatives said they treated all cases related to cultural or religious heritage with priority and in accordance with the laws in force.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador and other embassy officials continued to advocate with government officials to adopt and enact amendments to the law on religious freedom that would allow religious groups to acquire legal status.  They also urged government officials to respect religious freedom and pluralism and increase communication and cooperation with religious groups.  The Ambassador, a visiting senior Department of State official, and embassy officials met with government officials to urge them to implement the Constitutional and Supreme Court decisions ordering registration of land ownership to the Visoki Decani Monastery.  Embassy officials also urged the government to maintain the threatened Bektashi tekke (Sufi place of worship) in Prizren as a protected historical site.  The embassy frequently issued messages in the press and on social media in support of religious freedom.",

It emphasizes that religious tolerance is fundamental to the nation\u2019s unity, peace, reconciliation, and social cohesion and forbids speech that encourages religious hatred.\n\nLocal law enforcement and subnational government leaders continued to partner with religious groups on security matters to prevent violent extremism and protect their communities, especially in northern border areas, from what they stated was a continuing terrorist threat from the Sahel.  While secularism is embedded in national law, one religious leader said the state had sometimes preferred certain religions over others in the allocation of government financial support.  The government accredited 271 Islamic schools, bringing the total number of students in these accredited schools to 158,000.  The government continued to fund Christian religious pilgrimages as well as pilgrimages for Muslims to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThere were two reported incidents of conflicts between local Muslim communities and Christians.  In Anyama Commune, the predominantly Muslim community tried to block the construction of an evangelical church despite\u2019s the church\u2019s claim to the land.  The case remained pending before a court at year\u2019s end.  In Bassawa, the local Muslim community barricaded the village\u2019s Christian church, forcing it to close for more than a month until Christian leaders and local authorities successfully met with members of the Muslim community.  A Christian leader said an imam used inflammatory speech against Jews and Christians on social media in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack in Israel.  Another Christian leader said the government deported a pastor from Sierra Leone after the leader alerted authorities to the pastor\u2019s \u201cextremist\u201d preaching.  Some Muslim leaders stated they continued to prevent the influence of what they called intolerant forms of Islam, by providing imams with suggested themes for sermons, advising imams to closely vet guest preachers, and requiring traveling Muslim preachers to obtain advance approval of their sermons from local Muslim authorities.  Several Christian denominations also monitored hate speech and provided antiextremist training.  The Alliance of Religions for Peace in Cote d\u2019Ivoire met with civil society and government officials before the September elections to urge calm, respect for the results, and fair media coverage.\n\nU.S. embassy representatives continued to meet with government officials to discuss the state of religious freedom and tolerance in the country.  They raised topics including interreligious conflicts, threats violence, or harassment that targeted specific religious groups and the government\u2019s assessment of the threat of religiously motivated violent extremism in the country.  The Ambassador met individually with leaders of the Supreme Council of Imams, Mosques and Islamic Affairs of Cote d\u2019Ivoire (COSIM), the Catholic Archbishop of Abidjan, and the president of the Federation of Evangelical Churches of Cote d\u2019Ivoire to discuss the state of religious freedom in the country.

The IRCSL, formed to promote peaceful coexistence and collaboration among the country\u2019s various religious groups, said before the June 24 election that the election should be credible, free, fair, and nonviolent and that all sides should accept the results. A draft code of conduct prepared by the IRCSL to prevent and resolve religious disputes remained pending with the Ministry of Social Welfare (MSW), with the draft still in the deliberative stage at year\u2019s end.\n\nOne religious leader said that the negative use of social media and the proliferation of hate speech in the country, which was more prominent during the election campaign, undermined religious harmony. An Ahmadi Muslim leader said that what he called the hardline doctrine of Tablighi Muslims in the country threatened Ahmadis and negatively affected religious freedom. The IRCSL, with members drawn from 13 Christian and Muslim groups, continued to be the main nongovernmental body responsible for religious affairs.\n\nTo highlight the U.S. embassy\u2019s support for religious diversity, the Ambassador met with Christian and Muslim leaders of the IRCSL on multiple occasions to discuss the organization\u2019s engagement with the government to encourage free, peaceful, and pluralistic expression among all religious communities nationwide.",

The CCG held meetings and continued to encourage discussions with other faith-based groups, including evangelical Protestants and the Muslim community.\n\nThere is no permanent U.S. diplomatic presence in the country. The ambassador and representatives from the U.S. Embassy in Bridgetown, Barbados visited the country frequently and engaged with government officials on issues of religious freedom. In August and September, U.S. embassy officials discussed the government\u2019s support for religious diversity and tolerance during meetings with Minister for Health, Wellness, and Religious Affairs Jonathan LaCrette and other Ministry of Health officials.

The constitution states, \u201cSubject to law, public order, and morality, every citizen shall have the right to profess, practice, and propagate his religion.\u201d The penal code sets punishments for blasphemy that range from 10 years in prison to the death penalty, although the government has never executed anyone for blasphemy. It also states, \u201cA person of the Qadiani group or the Lahori group (who call themselves Ahmadis) is a non-Muslim.\u201d The constitution and penal code prohibit Ahmadis from acting or representing themselves as Muslims. Speech or action intended to incite religious hatred is punishable by up to seven years in prison.\n\nAccording to media reports, police at times killed or physically abused members of religious minorities or failed to protect individuals from violence linked to religion. Frequently, police accused of abuses were lightly sanctioned or not punished at all. In one case, police failed to protect a detainee facing blasphemy charges in Punjab\u2019s Nankana Sahib district; a mob stormed a police station and lynched him on February 11. Police suspended two senior officers for failing to prevent the lynching and ordered an investigation. The officers were reinstated after a departmental inquiry found them \u201cnot guilty of negligence, incompetence, and cowardice.\u201d\n\nAccording to the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Center for Social Justice (CSJ), 329 persons were accused of blasphemy during the year, of whom 75 percent were Muslims, 20 percent Ahmadi Muslims, and 3.3 percent Christians. One Hindu was also accused; the faith of the others was unknown. At least 171 persons were accused of blasphemy in 2022, according to CSJ. NGOs agreed the actual number of blasphemy cases was likely higher, but uneven reporting and lack of media coverage in many areas made it difficult to be precise. At least eight persons who had been charged previously, Muslim and Christian, received death sentences for blasphemy during the year, but none of the sentences were carried out. The Federal Investigative Agency (FIA) Cyber Crime Wing arrested 140 individuals for alleged blasphemy on social media; 11 received death sentences, two of which were confirmed by higher courts. On February 1, the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) degraded Wikipedia services for hosting \u201cblasphemous content.\u201d Social media platforms blocked more than 71,000 URLs containing \u201cobjectionable\u201d content at the agency\u2019s request. In August, the Senate passed legislation, approved earlier by the National Assembly, that would increase punishment for blasphemy in some cases. Civil society, legal activists, and the then Minister for Human Rights and Christian groups expressed concerns about the contents of the bill and how it had been approved. The President sent the bill back to parliament in August, but it could no longer be considered following dissolution of the National Assembly the same month.\n\nAccording to NGOs and media reports, individuals convicted and sentenced to death in well publicized blasphemy cases remained in prison for long periods while awaiting action on their appeals. Civil society and legal sources said some judges were hesitant to decide blasphemy cases due to fear of violence from persons they considered Islamist extremists if they did not impose harsh sentences. During the year, courts overturned some blasphemy convictions upon appeal and acquitted or granted bail to some individuals in prison on blasphemy charges; bail was exceedingly rare in cases that carried the death penalty. In some cases, judges set bail far above the amount required by law. There were reports that courts failed to adhere to basic evidentiary standards in blasphemy cases.\n\nThere were reported cases of government intervention and action by courts, law enforcement, and local authorities in situations of attempted forced marriage and forced conversion, which often included kidnapping. Enforcement action against those responsible was rare, however, and religious minorities continued to protest what they stated was the government\u2019s weak response. According to CSJ, there were 103 cases of forced marriage and the conversion of Christian, Hindu, and Sikh women and girls during the year. In January, a UN panel of experts said it was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by reports of the rise in abductions, forced marriages, and forced conversions of underage girls and women in the country.\n\nThe Ministry of Interior banned, monitored, or curtailed the activities of religiously oriented groups it judged to be extremist or terrorist. According to Ahmadiyya community leaders, authorities continued to target and harass Ahmadi Muslims for blasphemy, violations of \u201canti-Ahmadi laws,\u201d and other crimes, and regularly denied construction permits for their places of worship. Religious minority community representatives stated the government was inconsistent in safeguarding their members against societal discrimination and neglect, and that official discrimination against Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, and Ahmadi Muslims persisted to varying degrees, with Ahmadis saying they experienced the worst treatment. Government officials and politicians attended and spoke at Khatm-e-Nabuwat (Finality of Prophethood) conferences that secular and Ahmadi critics argued were venues for hate speech against Ahmadi Muslims. Human rights advocates and Ahmadiyya Muslim community leaders reported police and local authorities rarely took action to prevent attacks on, or to punish assailants who vandalized or destroyed, Ahmadi mosques, minarets, and gravestones. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in a February report, said the standardized national curriculum created an \u201cexclusionary narrative that sidelines Pakistan\u2019s religious minorities.\u201d Civil society groups continued to report that some madrassahs around the country taught doctrine they considered to promote violent extremism and intolerance toward religious minorities.\n\nThere were reports that armed sectarian groups continued to perpetrate violence against religious gatherings and buildings. In January, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at a mosque in a police compound in Peshawar that killed 100 and injured 169. On July 31, a suicide attack at a Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam \u2013 Fazal (JUI-F) political gathering in the Bajaur tribal district killed 54 persons and wounded at least 83; the Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K) claimed responsibility. A September 29 suicide bombing against a Sunni procession in Mastung, Balochistan, killed 57 and wounded 58 as Muslims celebrated the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s birthday.\n\nThroughout the year, individuals \u2013 often unidentified \u2013 assaulted and killed Hindus, Christians, Ahmadis, Sikhs, Sunnis, and Shia in attacks sources said were religiously motivated. Civil society organizations and media documented at least 16 persons killed for their faith during the year: seven Shia Muslims, four Sikhs, three Christians, one Hindu, and one Ahmadi Muslim. In February, police identified Inam-ul-Haque in the killing of Ahmadi doctor Rasheed Ahmad in Gotriala, Punjab. In May, unidentified gunmen shot and killed seven Shia teachers at a school in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province. In four incidents in Peshawar between March and June, unidentified men shot and killed three Sikh shopkeepers and a Christian sanitary worker. In attacks on August 16, a large mob that sources stated was incited by local Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) leaders destroyed churches, several homes of Christian families, and a cemetery in Faisalabad\u2019s Jaranwala subdistrict in response to a blasphemy allegation. Police arrested five Christians on blasphemy allegations and more than 350 protestors for the violence, including some TLP leaders. Attacks on Shia Hazaras in Balochistan resumed after a two-year lull, with three Hazara policemen killed in two incidents in Quetta. Activists and members of minority communities said the country\u2019s culture of impunity, along with state inaction, fueled hate crimes and blasphemy accusations.\n\nCivil society activists and media continued to report incidents of young Christian and Hindu women being abducted and raped by Muslim men. Ahmadis continued to report widespread societal harassment and discrimination against community members, including physical attacks, destruction of homes and personal property, and threats intended to force them to abandon their jobs or towns. There were also reports of attacks on religious minorities\u2019 holy places, cemeteries, and religious symbols. As of November, for example, there were at least five separate attacks on Ahmadi worship places in Karachi.\n\nChristian activists continued to report widespread discrimination against Christians in private employment other than menial labor. Ahmadiyya Muslim community representatives stated that the Urdu language press frequently printed hate speech, and inflammatory anti-Ahmadi rhetoric continued to exist on social media, at times spread by senior members of mainstream political parties. Community members stated clerics routinely delivered anti-Ahmadi sermons in mosques. Human rights and religious freedom activists and members of minority religious groups continued to report that they exercised caution when speaking in favor of religious tolerance because of a societal climate of intolerance and fear. Some activists reported receiving death threats because of their work.\n\nThe Ambassador, other U.S. embassy officers, and visiting senior U.S. officials including the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom engaged government officials to urge them to make progress on blasphemy laws and laws concerning Ahmadi Muslims, better protect members of religious minority communities, improve sectarian relations, and encourage interfaith respect. Embassy officers met with civil society leaders, experts, and journalists to collect information on religious freedom issues not covered in the media, stress the need to protect the rights of religious minorities, and offer support to victims of religion-based abuses. They also met with representatives of other embassies, leaders of religious communities, NGOs, and legal experts working on religious freedom issues to discuss ways to increase respect among religious groups and enhance dialogue. The embassy and consulates general highlighted religious freedom and examples of interfaith dialogue in the United States on their social media platforms throughout the year. The embassy and consulates general sponsored outreach activities such as speakers and workshops to promote religious freedom and peacebuilding among religious and community leaders.\n\nOn December 29, the Secretary of State redesignated Pakistan as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as amended, for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom and announced a waiver of the sanctions that accompany designation in the national interest of the United States.",

Local media outlets reported at least five individuals whom courts sentenced to either prison or house arrest due to their online religious activities.  In May, a court sentenced Jakhongir Ulugmuradov, a student at Tashkent State University of Economics, to three years in prison for sending a religious song to his classmates.  According to a BBC report, the mother of Sardor Rahmonkulov \u2013 who was sentenced to five years in prison in January for downloading and sharing a banned religious song but was alleged by the government to belong to a terrorist group \u2013 said her son was tortured in pretrial detention by members of the Tashkent Region police department to coerce him to confess to participating in extremist activities.  In March, Rahmonkulov\u2019s punishment was changed to conditional judgment, and he was released.  According to human rights activist Anvar Nazirov, Tashkent courts sentenced four members of an atheist Uzbek language Facebook group to three to five years of house arrest for \u201cinciting religious hatred\u201d after posting memes and jokes poking fun of Islam on a Facebook page.  In April, international religious freedom nongovernmental organization (NGO) Forum 18 published a report stating authorities had raided the Easter services of the Council of Churches Baptist Church in Qarshi.  According to the most recent government figures, there were 2,356 religious organizations officially registered in the country, 197 of which were non-Muslim.  The government reported it registered 13 Muslim organizations and one Christian organization during the year.  In October, the government adopted a law banning the wearing of garments that cover the face, which commentators said was a de facto ban on full-body burqas and niqabs.  Human rights activists continued to state that President Shavkat Mirziyoyev\u2019s reforms and the law on religion did not resolve the cases of prisoners who were incarcerated for their religious practices and beliefs prior to Mirziyoyev\u2019s accession to presidency in 2016 and remained incarcerated.  According to local activists, despite improvements and the release of many religious prisoners since the start of Mirziyoyev\u2019s presidency, a significant number of prisoners remained in custody for engaging in religious practices.  Former UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Religion or Belief Ahmed Shaheed released a follow-up report assessing the government\u2019s follow-through of his initial 2018 recommendations.  The report indicated that in almost every area, the government had either \u201cnot implemented\u201d or only \u201cpartially implemented\u201d his recommendations.\n\nHuman rights activists reported societal pressure to adopt Islamic customs and dress, which they attributed to the rise in openly practiced Islam.  They said many schoolgirls faced peer pressure to wear a headscarf.  Activists and human rights groups continued to report sporadic social pressure among the majority Muslim population against conversion from Islam to another religion.  Human rights activists reported an increase in anti-Christian and antisemitic content on social media channels of popular Islamic bloggers.\n\nIn its public outreach and private meetings, U.S. embassy officials drew attention to the continuing inability of religious groups to register as official religious organizations, of groups that proselytize to discuss their beliefs openly, and of parents to educate their children in their faith.  Embassy officials also raised the continuing detention and imprisonment of individuals based on their religious beliefs.  In March, the embassy hosted Ahmed Shaheed to discuss the country\u2019s progress in adopting his recommendations as special rapporteur following a 2017 visit.  Members of the government, civil society representatives, and foreign diplomats attended.  In May, nine members of the government participated in a U.S. government-sponsored program in the United States in which officials from the Committee for Religious Affairs (CRA), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National Human Rights Council, and the Ministry of Justice discussed religious freedom with U.S. government, NGO, and religious group representatives.  Embassy officials and visiting U.S. government officials also met with representatives of religious groups, civil society organizations, and relatives of religious prisoners to discuss freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.",

The government and the Tetovo Bektashi Community, a Sufi order, continued to differ on that religious group\u2019s registration. In October, the Skopje Basic Civil Court postponed a hearing on the issue and no further action was taken during the year. The Tetovo Bektashi Community continued to say its nonregistered status restricted its ability to acquire or use the Harabati Baba Teqe complex, its traditional headquarters, for religious activity. Tetovo Bektashi Community members and members of the government-registered Bektashi Religious Community (BRC), a different religious group, continued to dispute the IRC\u2019s claim of full ownership of and plans to renovate the Harabati Baba Teqe shrine. Tetovo Bektashi Community members again reported harassment by the government and BRC members. Christian and Muslim groups said the government\u2019s property restitution process continued to be slow and incomplete. The government, the MOC-OA, and the IRC resolved some differences on the regulation and accreditation of religious schools, but the MOC-OA withdrew its support for government recognition and funding of religious high schools, leaving MOC-OA and IRC-run high schools unaccredited, and students from those schools unable to enroll in secular universities. IRC leaders said relations with the government continued to improve but the government showed favoritism toward the MOC-OA. The Jewish Community continued to express regret that the government had not approved its 2017 initiative to amend the criminal code to criminalize antisemitism, Holocaust denial and distortion, or the glorification of Nazi and fascist symbols.\n\nIn April, the MOC-OA Archdiocese began to absorb the much smaller Orthodox Archbishophoric of Ohrid (OAO). The former OAO bishops were appointed to dioceses June 20, completing the merger of church personnel. The Jewish Community reported no violent acts against its members, but observers reported a significant increase in the number of other antisemitic incidents, including antisemitic speech and online incidents in October following the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and Israel\u2019s response.\n\nThe Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officials discussed the importance of tolerance, understanding, and interfaith dialogue among various religious groups with government representatives, including the director of the Committee on Relations between Religious Communities and Groups (CRRCG), mayors, and other officials.

The Ambassador and embassy officials met with the head of the MOC-OA, Archbishop Stefan of Ohrid and Macedonia, and IRC leader Reis Shaqir Fetahu to discuss religious freedom issues, including interfaith cooperation, the accreditation of religious schools, and perceived government favoritism toward certain religious groups.

The constitutional documents provide this right to churches and religious communities. The law prohibits public incitement to hostile acts against religious groups. Antidiscrimination legislation also prohibits discrimination on religious grounds. Citizens have the right to sue the government for constitutional violations of religious freedom.\n\nThe government continued its efforts to address hate crimes, including those motivated by religion, and specifically expanded efforts to address antisemitism. In February, the government released a report on its implementation of 26 of the 38 specific measures recommended by the 2021 National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism. In August, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) announced that it had commissioned the Documentation Center of the Austrian Resistance (DOeW) to prepare annual reports on right-wing extremism in the country. The first report is scheduled for publication in fall 2024 to cover 2020 to 2023. Another step to implement the National Strategy was achieved in December, when the parliament approved legislation amending and expanding penalties under the 1947 Nazi Prohibition Act, which now includes fines for display of Hamas or Hizballah imagery, outlines steps for dismissal of offenders from public office, and criminalizes posting hate speech on foreign social media or other platforms.\n\nBefore the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel, antisemitic incidents were reportedly on a downward trend, with the average number of incidents per day declining from 1.97 in 2022 to 1.55 from January to October 7. However, that number increased to 8.31 for the period October 7 to December 31. The Jewish Religious Society (IKG) reported 1,147 antisemitic incidents in 2023, compared to 719 in 2022, a 59.5 percent increase and the largest annual number since documentation began in 2008. In the two weeks following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel, coinciding with the Israeli military response, the IKG reported 76 antisemitic incidents, a 300 percent year-on-year increase. Dokustelle, an initiative of volunteers documenting anti-Muslim incidents, recorded 1,324 incidents in 2022, compared with 1,061 in 2021, its most recent annual statistics. In the month following October 7, Dokustelle stated it recorded more anti-Muslim incidents than in January \u2013 September 2023 combined, although it did not cite statistics. Many involved anti-Islamic graffiti and defacement of Muslim institutions, as well as physical and verbal attacks on Muslims, especially against women wearing headscarves.\n\nThe Ambassador and other U.S. embassy representatives met regularly with government officials, including from the Federal Chancellery\u2019s Office for Religious Affairs, the MOI, the Ministry for Women and Integration, and the Division of Dialogue of Cultures and Religions at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), to discuss religious freedom issues. Embassy officers also met with leaders of religious youth organizations to discuss issues such as increased antisemitism and anti-Muslim sentiment, particularly since the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel.\n\nIn May, the embassy hosted the U.S. Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues, who emphasized the importance of respect for religious freedom and tolerance in meetings with Jewish community leaders, parliamentarians, and nongovernmental organization (NGO) representatives. Throughout the year, the embassy used social media to amplify messages and highlight embassy engagements, underscoring the U.S. commitment to freedom of religion or belief for all. Particularly after October 7, the embassy used social media, meetings, and other engagements to condemn antisemitic incidents in the country and denounce all forms of hate. This included raising awareness of disinformation designed to spread antisemitism and anti-Muslim sentiment.",

Some local and provincial governments, particularly in Aceh Province, have laws and regulations restricting religious observance, such as regulations banning Shia or Ahmadi Islamic practice.\n\nAuthorities continued to detain and sentence individuals to prison for violations of blasphemy laws.  In Aceh, the only province to follow sharia, authorities conducted numerous public canings for violations, such as consuming or selling alcohol, gambling, and extramarital sex.  Residents from religious majorities in certain communities sometimes successfully pressured local authorities to delay or deny the construction or renovation of houses of worship for local religious minorities.  Government officials and police also sometimes failed to prevent religious and religiously affiliated groups from committing other acts of intimidation, such as damaging or destroying houses of worship and homes.  The 2023 annual report of the Setara Institute on Democracy and Peace cited a total of 230 actions infringing on religious freedom during the year.\n\nDuring the year, government institutions conducted numerous actions, including organizing forums and collaborative international events that publicly advocated religious tolerance and interfaith dialogue.  Some religious minority groups reported success in obtaining permits to build houses of worship and rebuild destroyed structures.\n\nThe Ambassador and other embassy and consulate officials, as well as visiting senior State Department officials, advocated religious freedom with the government, including at the highest levels.  Issues raised included actions against religious minorities, closures of places of worship, access for foreign religious organizations, the revised blasphemy provisions in the criminal code, convictions for blasphemy and defamation of religion, the importance of tolerance and rule of law, and the application of sharia to non-Muslims.  The Ambassador and embassy, consulate, and visiting U.S. officials conducted extensive outreach to promote respect for diversity and religious tolerance through hosting of religious freedom and interfaith events, media interviews, social media initiatives, digital and public speaking engagements, youth exchanges, and educational programs.",

Because religion, ethnicity, and political ideology are closely linked, it was often difficult to determine whether incidents were predominantly motivated by religion.  In January, security forces killed a member of a secret society as he and colleagues performed traditional rituals during a memorial service in Bambui, Northwest Region.  In July, security forces looking for separatists burned down the Mejang village palace, considered sacred in Northwest Region, killing the traditional ruler\u2019s mother.  Both incidents sparked widespread outrage.  Religious leaders expressed frustration with the government\u2019s long-running failure to register new religious groups and said many requests were pending, some for a decade or longer.\n\nThe U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa (ISIS-WA) continued to launch violent attacks against local communities, disrupt church activities, and cause Christians to live in fear in the Far North Region.  The overall number of terrorist incidents increased during the year, following a decrease the year prior.  In August, ISIS-WA terrorists killed eight fishermen on the island of Darak in Lake Chad, where the limited presence of security and government authorities allowed them to establish a base from which to carry out attacks against those who oppose their ideology, including Christians.  In June, during the feast of Eid al-Adha, ISIS-WA terrorists kidnapped 13 individuals, including women and children, in Mordas in the Far North Region and took them to their base in the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nIn July, violent clashes between the Christian Hourza community and the Muslim Mandara community in Warba, Far North Region, resulted in the death of two Muslims, multiple other casualties, the burning of many shops and at least one mosque, and the displacement of 4,574 people.  Calm only returned after the intervention of security forces.  Longstanding tensions between mostly Muslim Mbororo-Fulani herders and mainly Christian local populations over land disputes have worsened since the start of the NOSO separatist crisis in 2017, according to human rights experts.  In April, Fulani herders kidnapped at least 25 persons in Ako, Northwest Region, during a weeklong series of attacks.  In July, suspected Fulani militias attacked two individuals in Acha Tugi, Northwest Region, killing a man and seriously injuring his wife.  In September, the nongovernmental organizations (NGO) Center for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa reported that Mbororo-Fulani herders carried out at least five killings in the Northwest Region in the first half of the year.\n\nU.S. embassy officials engaged with government officials and traditional leaders to discuss issues including the need for interfaith dialogue, the danger posed by the crisis in NOSO to religious practitioners, the education of young Muslim girls, and the problem of child marriage in predominantly Muslim communities.  In September, embassy officials met with the Grand Imams and Regional Council presidents of the North and Adamawa Regions and discussed the state of religious affairs in their regions.  Embassy officials met with multiple religious leaders, including the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon (PCC) moderator, members of the Cameroon Association for Interreligious Dialogue (ACADIR), the director of Caritas Kumbo (the development arm of the Catholic Diocese of Kumbo), and evangelical leaders, such as the pastors of Harvest Intercontinental Unlimited and the Full Gospel Mission.  They discussed the ability of individual groups to practice their religions freely and the limitations on religious freedom resulting from cultural practices and the NOSO crisis.",

The constitution provides for states to establish courts based on sharia or customary (traditional) law in addition to common law civil courts, although civil courts have preeminence over all other courts.  Sentences may be appealed from sharia and customary courts to civil courts.  In addition to civil courts, sharia courts function in 12 northern states and the Federal Capital Territory, and customary courts in most of the 36 states.\n\nIn May, the Sultan of Sokoto and cochair of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, said the resurgence of insecurity and killings across the country was worrisome.  The Sultan said NIREC would engage with the new government to find a solution to the insecurity.  In a statement issued in September, Catholic bishops urged the state and national governments to stand up to their \u201cprimary responsibility of safeguarding the lives and property of Nigerians.\u201d  The Christian-oriented research group Observatory for Religious Freedom in Africa (ORFA) stated in an April report that both criminal gangs and terrorist organizations were increasingly attacking local communities, particularly Christian communities, leading to a climate of fear and displacement of populations, and the government in many cases failed to protect citizens against the attacks.\n\nMedia reported that military and police attacked members of the government-proscribed Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) during an Ashura procession in Abuja, with one person shot in the head and two individuals sustaining fractures in their legs.  At year\u2019s end, Humanist Association of Nigeria President and former Muslim Mubarak Bala continued to serve a 24-year prison sentence for his conviction on charges that he had insulted Islam and Muslims with the intent to cause a breach of public peace.  At year\u2019s end, the retrial of Muslim singer Yahaya Sharif-Aminu for insulting the Prophet Muhammad remained pending before the Supreme Court.  In December, a judge released Rhoda Jatau, a Christian, on bail after 18 months in detention; her trial on blasphemy charges continued.  In August, authorities detained Adegbola Abdulazeez, an Isese (Yoruba traditional religion) priest and activist based in Oyo State, for insulting the emir and other Muslim leaders in Kwara State.  In response to a June fatal mob attack against an alleged blasphemer, the Sokoto State governor issued a statement urging individuals not to take the law into their own hands but also noting the government would \u201cdeal decisively with anyone found guilty of any act aimed at degrading the personality of Prophet Muhammad.\u201d  Jewish groups reported discrimination over the government\u2019s lack of religious accommodation for their observance of the Sabbath on Saturdays.  In September, the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) said appointments since the President\u2019s inauguration in May had favored Christians at the expense of Muslims.  Some Christians reported difficulty buying land to build churches in some northern cities but said delays and difficulties were not absolute and construction of churches was taking place.  On March 8, during a webinar sponsored by Catholic organization Aid to the Church in Need, Archbishop Matthew Man-oso Ndagoso of Kaduna said Christians in northern states were unable to build churches or other Christian infrastructure because local officials did not issue construction permits.  In April, the Federal High Court nullified some sections of The Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA).  The court ruled it infringed on citizens\u2019 exercise of human rights, including \u201cfreedom of thought, conscience, and religion,\u201d as enumerated in the constitution.  In August, after some family members threatened to kill a Muslim woman for converting to Christianity, a court in Plateau State ruled that she was free to change her religion and granted her protection from those threatening her.\n\nAccording to the Global Terrorism Index, in 2023 the country experienced its first increase in deaths from terrorism in three years, with deaths from terrorism up 34 percent, to 524 persons.  The report stated the higher death toll was principally due to a surge in the conflict between ISIS-WA and Boko Haram.  Terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and ISIS-WA, continued to attack population centers and religious targets, including churches and mosques, and maintained an ability to stage forces in rural areas and launch attacks against civilian and military targets across the North East and elsewhere in the country, according to observers.  In February, ORFA published a report on killings and abductions in the country; ORFA concluded that terror groups killed Christians proportionately in much greater numbers than Muslims.  The report, however, did not draw conclusions regarding whether Christians were targeted based on their religious identity.  On September 15, the Catholic Bishops Conference said in a statement, \u201cInsecurity has remained a persistent problem in our country as insurgents, herdsmen militia, bandits, and so-called \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 have continued to unleash terror in different parts of the country.\u201d  ISIS-WA efforts to implement shadow governance structures in large swaths of the region remained limited to the fringes of Lake Chad in the extreme North East, according to media reports.  According to the Global Terrorism Index, ISIS-WA and Boko Haram remained the two deadliest terrorist groups in the country, together responsible for 427 deaths during the year.  In October, a report released by Nigerian security risk management firm Beacon Consulting stated that suspected Boko Haram members killed more than 252 persons in Borno State by in August alone in addition to many killings in the preceding months.\n\nGovernment security services, NGOs, media, academics, and other observers said the level of insecurity driven by rising criminality continued to worsen during the year.  In September, a Catholic seminarian was burned to death when bandits attacked the residence of the chancellor of the Catholic Diocese of Kafanchan in the Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State.  Bandits attacked a mosque in the Ikara Local Government Area of Kaduna State and killed seven worshippers in September.  Numerous fatal clashes occurred throughout the year in the North Central Region between predominantly Christian farmers from various ethnic groups and predominantly Muslim herders.  On December 24, armed gunmen launched coordinated attacks on more than 17 villages in Plateau State, killing more than 150 persons, mostly Christians, and injuring and displacing thousands of others.  Between mid-April and early July, attackers reportedly killed more than 200 persons, most of them Christian, in the Mangu Local Administrative Area in Plateau State.  The Church of the Brethren in Nigeria, EYN, also reported that Boko Haram and Fulani militias killed 18 persons in attacks during the Christmas season on four of their communities in Borno State.  In March, Fulani herdsmen killed at least 60 Christians in Benue State, according to media outlets.  Also in March, armed men killed 17 Christians in the Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State.  According to media outlets, in September, Fulani herdsmen killed 10 Christians in Plateau State, where 27 others were slain in August.  Some Christian leaders said they believed herdsmen\u2019s attacks were motivated by a desire to take over Christians\u2019 lands as desertification has made it difficult for them to sustain their herds, while others said that in many cases the attackers were bandit groups that disguised themselves as herdsmen.  Fulani leaders said the killings were reprisals for earlier killings of Fulani herders.  According to the NGO Open Doors, there were 4,118 Christians killed, 3,300 abducted, and 100,000 internally displaced in the country during the period October 2022 to September 2023.  There were numerous kidnappings for ransom involving members of clergy.  According to Aid to the Church in Need, as of late November, 23 Catholic priests, sisters, and seminarians had been kidnapped during the year, and there were several killings as well.  In June, a mob in Sokoto stoned to death a Muslim man accused of blaspheming Islam during an argument at a market.  On September 1, gunmen killed at least seven persons at Friday prayers at a mosque in Saya village, Kaduna State.  During morning prayers on October 24, bandits attacked another mosque in Kaduna, killing the imam and two other worshipers.  Lawyers representing or considering representing individuals accused of blasphemy stated they were discreet about identifying themselves, given possible threats against them.\n\nU.S. embassy and consulate general representatives and visiting U.S. government representatives raised religious freedom issues with government officials throughout the year, including the resolution of widely publicized blasphemy cases, the role of religious leaders in peacebuilding and enhancing social trust, and societal abuses affecting religion.  The Ambassador and other embassy officials engaged with various religious groups, including the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Society for the Support of Islam (JNI), the Islamic Society of Removal of Innovation and Reestablishment of the Sunna, and others throughout the year.  The embassy supported efforts to address conflict among targeted at-risk communities by facilitating dialogue between aggrieved parties, promoting respect for religious freedom, and training community and religious leaders to peacefully resolve disputes.  The embassy funded three activities that sought to strengthen engagement and reduce tensions related to farmer-herder and other conflicts in Borno, Adamawa, Yobe, Benue, Delta, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kogi, and Plateau States.  The embassy continued to fund interfaith dialogue training for leaders in six North West and North Central states.",

The Roman Catholic and Eastern Rite Catholic Churches, the Anglican Church, two evangelical Christian groups, and the Ethiopian, Coptic, Armenian Apostolic, and Assyrian Orthodox Churches hold religious legal entity status under a 2014 law. Other religious groups, such as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Scientologists, and Baha\u2019is, have civil association legal status. By law, religious officials of known religions and official religious legal entities must register with the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs.\n\nIn January, a court in Agrinio acquitted two Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses of proselytism charges. Also in January, police arrested former parliamentarian Petros Tatsopoulos on grounds he \u201cinsulted the religious conscience and freedom of worship\u201d of self-characterized conservative patriotic Hellenic Solution party member Filippos Kambouris. In March, police reported having cooperated with the National Intelligence Service (EYP) and Israel\u2019s Mossad to dismantle a terrorist network planning attacks during Passover on a Chabad synagogue and a kosher restaurant in Athens. In April, parliament passed a law prohibiting individuals convicted of certain crimes, including running a criminal organization, from leading political parties or running in national elections. Based on this law, in May, the Supreme Court rejected the application of the self-characterized far-right Hellenes party (founded by the incarcerated leader of the outlawed Golden Dawn party, known for its antisemitic and anti-Islamic rhetoric) to compete in national elections. In June, an appeals court acquitted two human rights activists on charges of \u201cfiling a false complaint\u201d of racist and antisemitic hate speech against a Greek Orthodox Metropolitan. Government-appointed acting muftis continued to lead all three muftiates in Thrace, which drew objections from some ethnic Turks and Turkish-speaking members of the Muslim Minority of Thrace. During the year, the government granted permits for the establishment of 14 houses of prayer and revoked permits of nine. In September, the country\u2019s top administrative court reiterated that only non-Orthodox Christian pupils could be exempted from religious education, even though parents and the Union of Atheists filed appeals advocating for \u201cblanket\u201d exemptions on grounds of conscience. In March, the Athens Bar Association (a legal entity of public law) disbarred Konstantinos Plevris, defense attorney of the defunct neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, for giving Nazi salutes in the courtroom during the trial of a former Golden Dawn member of the European Parliament. In October, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister publicly condemned as antisemitic the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel, including in a series of official social media posts emphasizing the continuing need to prevent antisemitism.\n\nAccording to the Racist Violence Recording Network (RVRN), an initiative of the Greek National Commission for Human Rights and the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 74 incidents of discrimination and discrimination-related violence were recorded in 2022, compared with 28 in 2021. Of these incidents, police attributed nine such incidents to religious discrimination, compared with 19 in 2021. Because religion and ethnicity are often closely linked, however, it was difficult to categorize many incidents as being solely based on religious identity. In February, media outlets reported unknown individuals physically attacked Imam Achmet, president of the Thrace-based Pomak Panhellenic Association. According to Achmet, ethnically Turkish members of the Muslim Minority in Thrace targeted him due to his outspoken insistence that Pomaks have a cultural identity distinct from that of Turkish members of the Muslim minority, and because he would not succumb to pressures to say he was Turkish. In October, police arrested a Syrian national who was \u201cbehaving strangely\u201d inside a Greek Orthodox church in central Athens; police found a knife in his bag. In January, a mural commemorating the deportation of Jews from Thessaloniki to Nazi death camps during World War II was defaced. In October, unknown individuals painted \u201cFree Gaza/Palestine\u201d and \u201cJews = Nazis\u201d on the same mural.\n\nThe Ambassador and other U.S. embassy and consulate general representatives met with a range of government and civil society leaders to discuss religious freedom, interfaith dialogue, and combating antisemitism and Holocaust denial and distortion. Interlocutors included Secretary General for Religious Affairs George Kalantzis; officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including the Special Envoy for Combatting Antisemitism; and regional and local government representatives. Embassy and consulate general officials also met with primates of the Orthodox Church; the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Athens; representatives from the Central Board of the Jewish Communities in Greece (KIS); members of the Athens Mosque Committee and members of the Muslim Minority in Thrace; and representatives of the Church of Scientology and the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.

In a change from recent years, Shia Muslims did not report government surveillance during major religious holidays. Multiple religious minority group leaders said that there had been no incidents of religious violence or oppression during the year and again attributed the government\u2019s relative restraint to engagement from the United States and others on religious freedom issues. Private Shia commemorations of all Eid holidays, Ramadan, and Ashura proceeded peacefully on the three islands. Shia Muslims on Anjouan said that local authorities continued to prevent them from practicing in the Shia mosque that had existed on the island for several years; they were forced to worship in a Shia community center due to political concerns involving the former president who built the mosque with help from Iran.\n\nThere continued to be reports that local communities unofficially shunned individuals who were suspected of converting from Islam to Christianity or from Sunni to Shia Islam. In other cases, local communities intervened to try and convince those changing their religious beliefs or practices to remain committed to Sunni Islam.\n\nRepresentatives from the U.S. Embassy in Antananarivo, Madagascar, engaged on issues of religious freedom with government officials, including the President and officials in multiple ministries. The representatives focused on the importance of individuals having the ability to practice their religion freely and of government officials refraining from statements criticizing religious minorities.

The law prohibits all religious activity by unregistered groups and requires all registered religious groups to obtain permits to proselytize or hold events outside of their premises, as well as prior approval from the authorities to import and distribute religious literature.\n\nAuthorities continued to use laws regulating \u201cmass events\u201d to target members of the clergy and members of religious groups engaged in the prodemocracy movement that emerged following the 2020 fraudulent presidential election, as well as those groups protesting Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Authorities detained numerous religious leaders in connection with these 2020 and 2022 protests, including a religious education teacher at the Roman Catholic cathedral in Minsk. The teacher remained in pretrial detention at year\u2019s end on criminal charges of inciting religious and social hatred, accused of using the cathedral towers to monitor the movements of security forces and warn protesters.

In June, authorities prosecuted and ultimately fined a Baptist pastor for publicly proselytizing without authorization. Human rights organizations said authorities restricted clergy access to prisons and denied pastoral visits to some political prisoners. According to observers, authorities continued surveillance of registered and unregistered religious groups, including through monitoring of social media. In June, Minsk city authorities bulldozed a building formerly owned by the evangelical Christian New Life Church following a years-long dispute with tax authorities. In October, following government accusations that information on the church\u2019s social media accounts regarding the political and social situation in the country was extremist, a Minsk court shut down the church and revoked its registration, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court in December. The Catholic Church of St. Simon and St. Helena in Minsk remained closed following a 2022 fire that church leaders said did not do extensive damage; a Minsk city official said in October that repair and restoration work would start in 2024, after which the government would decide on the group\u2019s request to allow reopening of the church.\n\nAccording to media reports, on December 20, Plenipotentiary Representative for Religious and Nationality Affairs Alyaksandr Rumak and head of the Ideology Department of the Minsk city executive committee Volha Chamadanava warned the BOC Diocese of Minsk clergy against engaging in political activity, demonstrating any opposition or extremist symbols in churches, and praying for the victory of Ukraine, threatening them with criminal prosecution.\n\nIn the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict, there were numerous antisemitic comments circulating on social media. Following the arrival of a November evacuation flight from Israel, hundreds of commentators urged the government against welcoming the evacuees and questioned the loyalty and patriotism of those evacuated. Other social media commentary included derogatory references to the Jewish identity of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. An interreligious working group comprising the largest religious groups organized multiple seminars on issues related to religion and society.\n\nThe Charge d\u2019Affaires and other U.S. embassy personnel engaged with religious leaders and civil society activists on religious freedom issues, including registration of religious communities, state pressure on clergy, freedom to express and practice religious beliefs, freedom of expression for clergy who participated in activities authorities considered political, and antisemitism. The Charg\u00e9 and other embassy personnel met with Jewish groups to discuss antisemitism and the preservation of Jewish cultural heritage and participated in a November event in Minsk commemorating Holocaust victims. The Charg\u00e9 and other embassy representatives also engaged Orthodox Christians, Roman Catholics, Protestants, and other groups as well as civil society activists, to learn about their religious activities and to discuss the regime\u2019s actions affecting the exercise of religious freedom.",

He was arrested in 2022 reportedly in reaction to a sermon he preached condemning the \u201ctyranny\u201d of the government.  Maye and others continued to state he was mistreated in detention.  Leaders of some evangelical Christian churches continued to say that the registration regulations, especially the requirement that their clergy obtain a theological certificate from the national university, affected them adversely and were enforced inconsistently.  Persistent negative societal views concerning evangelical churches, including views expressed by some government-owned media, also hampered some churches\u2019 attempts to reregister, according to evangelical leaders.  The government closed six evangelical and Pentecostal churches during the year for not complying with registration requirements.  In September, the Senate recommended changes to the law on religious freedom to \u201cprotect the people\u201d by combating the \u201cbad practices of cults and religious confessions.\u201d  According to sources, the Senate recommendations would substantially increase government oversight of religious groups and likely would restrict the ability of evangelical, Pentecostal, and other minority religious groups to perform their religious practices.  Evangelical Christians continued to report that residency permits were prohibitively expensive and difficult to obtain, leading some missionaries to risk the consequences of not obtaining or renewing their permits, or to leave the country altogether.\n\nThere were no reports of significant societal actions affecting religious freedom during the year.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador met with government officials, including the former MJRAPI Minister, to discuss the importance of religious freedom, including efforts to promote religious tolerance and respect for human rights.  U.S embassy officials spoke with Catholic officials to discuss interfaith projects and events.  Embassy officials also met with evangelical Christian pastors to discuss the continuing impact of church registration requirements, and with Baha\u2019i and Muslim community representatives to discuss religious freedom and religious tolerance in the country.",

Evangelical Christian pastors working in gang-controlled areas said the State of Exception continued to impact their congregations and church programs, particularly those working with former gang members.  In March, Cardinal Gregorio Rosa Chavez said that under the State of Exception, many religious leaders had chosen to self-censor and preferred not to express their concerns regarding violations of human rights and due process because they feared potential government retaliation.  According to the Ministry of Governance, there were 281 requests for registration of religious groups during the year, compared with 312 in 2022.  In June, the Office of the Attorney General brought criminal charges against eight individuals, among them former President Alfredo Cristiani, for involvement in the 1989 execution of six Jesuit priests and their housekeeper during the country\u2019s civil war.  The General Prisons Directorate continued to severely restrict access to prisons, denying access to some representatives of religious groups.\n\nDuring the year, media outlets reported that because of the State of Exception, gangs could no longer effectively restrict religious groups\u2019 access to neighborhoods or extort businesses, organizations, or individuals.\n\nU.S. embassy officials discussed human rights, including religious freedom, with the ombudsman for human rights and the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, who agreed on the importance of religious tolerance.  In meetings with civil society organizations, including those with religious affiliation, embassy officials discussed the country\u2019s tolerance and respect for religious diversity.  Embassy officials met with religious leaders from Pentecostal, Baptist, and Catholic Churches and with Jewish religious leaders to discuss religious freedom and other related human rights issues.

The government announced that it would fully investigate the attack.  On May 17, President Saied met with leaders of the country\u2019s three primary religious communities.  According to country\u2019s Chief Rabbi, the president assured them that such an attack \u201cwould not happen again.\u201d  On October 17, in the wake of Hamas\u2019 attack on southern Israel, pro-Palestinian rioters defaced and set fire to a closed synagogue and shrine in central Tunisia.  Local police responded but were overwhelmed by the rioters.  In response, President Saied publicly called on Tunisians to stand by the Palestinian people \u201cwithout attacking anyone or any property.\u201d  Authorities had not reported any arrests associated with the incident as of year\u2019s end.\n\nOn February 22, police detained the president and vice-president of the Federation of Evangelical, Protestant, and Pentecostal Christian Churches after a local television station profiled \u201chouse churches\u201d associated with their organization.  Authorities released the men without charges on March 10.  Police detained another Christian in February, as he left church in Tunis, and interrogated him regarding his religion and books in his possession; he was released the same day without charges.  The government had not provided updates regarding the case of Slimane Bouhafs, a Christian Algerian citizen who had been granted asylum in the country and was later extradited back to Algeria, as of year\u2019s end.  According to a local nongovernmental organization (NGO), the government supports extradition of foreign Christians to their home countries.  The government continued to reject Baha\u2019i citizens\u2019 efforts to form an association.  The government continued to ban niqabs and other face coverings on the premise that the ban is required due to national security considerations.  Christian citizens continued to report strong pressure from the government to restrict any public discussion or display of their religion.  A local NGO reported that police had harassed and interrogated Christians regarding their displays of Bibles and crosses.  Non-Catholic Christian citizens continued to report that they were denied the right to establish a legal entity that would allow for the establishment of a church.  The Jewish community reported that students who attended private Jewish schools were unable to receive certification from the government stating that they were students.\n\nReligious communities who signed a charter advocating peace in 2022 reported that they continued to be targets of anonymous insults and violence.  Atheists reported pressure from their Muslim families to revert to Islam or keep their atheism hidden.  Some Christians, especially converts reported rejection from their families and society, which included threats, violence, and banishment from their homes.  In June, a Christian was accused of \u201cwitchcraft\u201d and physically assaulted by intruders in his home in Tunis.  The authorities had not charged anyone with the assault as of year\u2019s end.  Some civil society organizations reported a growing number of Muslim converts to Christianity, but who, due to social stigma, kept their conversions secret.  They reported that families accused converts of bringing \u201cshame\u201d due to their conversion.\n\nThe Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officials maintained regular contact with multiple governmental agencies on the topic of religious freedom.  The embassy also maintained regular contact with multiple religious groups regarding their security and freedom to worship without restrictions from the government or harassment by the community. \n\nIn May, the U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism visited Tunisia, and held meetings with government officials, members of the Jewish community, civil society organizations, and university students.  Before the May 9 attack, the Special Envoy and the Ambassador visited Djerba to attend the annual Lag B\u2019Omer pilgrimage and to meet with members of the Jewish community to discuss the practice of their faith and challenges they face.  The embassy\u2019s social media platforms highlighted the event as demonstrating U.S. commitment to advancing freedom of religion and peaceful coexistence.  The Ambassador returned to Djerba on May 18 to offer condolences to the victims of the May 9 attack and to meet with members of the Jewish community.  The Ambassador also visited a mosque and a Catholic church to highlight Tunisia\u2019s longstanding support for religious coexistence.  In June, the embassy organized a workshop, bringing together leaders of 14 faith-based organizations and minority rights associations from Tunisia, Lebanon, and Morocco.

The law permits the federal government to characterize \u201cnontraditional\u201d religious groups as \u201csects\u201d and to provide warnings about them to the public.\n\nDomestic intelligence services continued to monitor numerous Muslim groups and mosques with ties to violent Islamic extremists, the Church of Scientology (COS), and two Protestant groups. On December 19, a Duesseldorf court sentenced a German-Iranian to 33 months in prison for aggravated and attempted arson of a synagogue in the city of Bochum. The prosecutor linked the act to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The Koblenz District Court convicted three men of membership in the banned Islamic terrorist group Caliphate State and of disseminating propaganda at a mosque, issuing suspended prison sentences of 14 to 18 months. The Ministry of Defense appointed two new rabbis as chaplains, bringing the total to five, but there were still no Muslim military chaplains. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses said authorities often showed little interest in pursuing crimes against their members, and multiple cities continued to restrict or ban their use of display carts with religious literature. In August, the mayor of Frankfurt called for the closure of the city\u2019s Center for Islamic Culture, citing its political activity and Iranian ties. Two new synagogues opened in Saxony-Anhalt, built with substantial government funding. In September, the country\u2019s first accredited Islamic seminary, supported with federal and state government funds, graduated its inaugural class of male and female students. Ahmadi Muslims again said several Ahmadis were denied asylum.\n\nSecurity forces increased protection of Jewish sites after the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, which was followed by a rise in antisemitic incidents, including violence. Officials across all parties and levels of government condemned the post-October 7 incidents, and prominent politicians condemned antisemitism throughout the year. Federal and state governments funded Jewish groups and institutions, increasing the funding for some, and projects to combat antisemitism. In June, parliament unanimously approved the erection of a memorial for Jehovah\u2019s Witness victims under National Socialism.\n\nThere were numerous antisemitic, anti-Muslim, and anti-Christian incidents, including physical attacks, threats, harassment, discrimination, demonstrations, and vandalism. According to preliminary figures from the Ministry of Interior, a total of 5,154 crimes were motivated by antisemitism during the year, an increase of 95 percent compared to 2022; 56 people were injured in such incidents. The number of crimes motivated by anti-Muslim hatred rose 140 percent during the year to 1,464 incidents that resulted in 53 injuries. The ministry attributed most antisemitic and anti-Muslim crimes to right-wing extremists; Jewish groups and others also cited left-wing extremists or Muslims as perpetrators of antisemitic crimes. At a Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses gathering in Hamburg in March, a man shot and killed seven Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and injured eight before killing himself. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses reported assaults on more than 50 members engaged in religious activities between September 2022 and June 2023. Attacks against Jews included an assault on a Jewish tourist in Berlin in August by three unknown persons after they heard him speaking Hebrew, and a December assault by six persons on a Jewish tourist wearing a kippa in Munich; in October, unknown persons threw Molotov cocktails at a Berlin synagogue. The nongovernmental organization (NGO) RIAS reported 177 antisemitic demonstrations, many of them violent, in five states between October 7 and November 9. Attacks against Muslims included an assault by seven soccer fans on a Muslim family in Merseburg in January and an assault on a Muslim girl wearing a headscarf at a bus stop in Hamburg in December. There were also reports of threats to and vandalism of mosques. Muslims reported an increase in anti-Muslim incidents after the October Hamas attacks against Israel.\n\nThe U.S. embassy and the five consulates general in the country continued to engage closely with all levels of government regarding responses to incidents of religious intolerance. The embassy and consulates general worked closely with Jewish communities and federal and state government officials to support programs promoting religious tolerance and countering violent extremism related to religion and antisemitism. In January, the Second Gentleman of the United States and the U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism visited Berlin, focusing on Holocaust remembrance and combating rising antisemitism. In November, the Special Envoy met with a wide range of federal and state officials, Jewish leaders, and others to discuss antisemitism efforts. In November, the Ambassador launched a program for youth to combat intolerance, antisemitism, and all forms of hatred. The Ambassador and embassy and consulate general representatives met with members and leaders of numerous local and national religious and civil society groups regarding their concerns related to tolerance and freedom of religion. With Muslims, they discussed topics including discrimination, anti-Muslim prejudice, and the need for interreligious dialogue. The Ambassador regularly highlighted her family\u2019s history of fleeing religious persecution to promote religious freedom and tolerance and point out society\u2019s responsibility to act against threats to religious freedom.

International religious freedom nongovernmental organization (NGO) Forum 18 reported eight Sunni Muslims were serving sentences connected to their religious activities or beliefs as of September. These included Dadash Mazhenov, serving an eight-year prison sentence for sharing religious talks on his social media page and denied transfer to a labor camp closer to his home as punishment for praying while standing after the lights were turned off for the evening. NGOs reported the actual number of Muslims serving prison sentences connected to peaceful religious activities or beliefs was likely higher. Freed prisoners continued to experience frozen bank accounts for extended periods and restrictions on their activities, including religious activities. The government continued not to approve the registration of Muslim groups apart from those observing the Sunni Hanafi school, although NGOs reported some non-Hanafi Muslim communities continued to worship informally without government interference. In October, the head of the National Security Committee told parliament legislation was necessary to make laws regulating religious activity more stringent. In November, the Prime Minister told parliament the government intended to introduce legislation addressing a \u201cdestructive religious trend,\u201d and dealing with the rehabilitation of \u201cadherents of destructive religious currents.\u201d The government had not proposed new legislation by year\u2019s end.\n\nRepresentatives of religious groups continued to report that in some regions, individual venues refused to rent space to them, possibly under pressure from local authorities. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses stated that on three occasions, authorities interrupted religious meetings held in rented facilities. Authorities continued to use the religion law to harass and restrict minority religious groups with fines and limitations on their activities. Forum 18 reported 143 administrative prosecutions for violations of the religion law in 2022 and 110 in the first half of 2023, compared with 130 in 2021. Authorities reported the most common violations were posting religious materials online without permission, offering for free or selling religious items or materials without permission, and attending worship meetings not approved by the state. Forum 18 reported that two Muslims from the ethnic Dungan community were fined for teaching children on religious topics without state permission, and at least 10 persons, all Muslims, were prosecuted and fined in the first half of the year for maintaining and using places of prayer without state permission.\n\nNew Life Church representatives reported that authorities returned properties confiscated in connection with the 2019 conviction of three Church pastors accused of using hypnotism and psychological manipulation to defraud parishioners; the three pastors remained outside the country. Local Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses associations, some of which had had their bank accounts closed in 2021, reported no further difficulties following positive government action in 2022. The government continued to ban import of 10 Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses religious publications, and the Church of Scientology reported cases of censorship. In November, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses reported that a military court in Almaty had ruled in favor of a military service exemption for one of their members, the first ruling of its kind.\n\nSources stated a government ban on religious attire in schools continued to be implemented inconsistently. In October, the Minister of Education stated that in one region of the country, more than 150 girls were not attending school because they could not find an acceptable accommodation on headscarves. Some Muslims reported discrimination in government employment against those who wore headscarves, beards, or other Islamic dress. In October, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev expressed support for both secularism and preservation of \u201ctraditional\u201d forms of Kazakh religion. He described secularism as \u201cpragmatism, commitment to a healthy lifestyle, reverence for our traditional religion, and preservation of national consciousness.\u201d Religious leaders reported that through the year, representatives of the CRA in many regions met with local communities to help resolve misunderstandings that could lead to abuses of the legal rights of religious communities.\n\nAccording to observers and members of minority religious groups, religious groups regarded as \u201cnontraditional,\u201d including Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Baptists and other evangelical Protestants, and Muslims who chose to wear headscarves or other identifying attire, continued to face greater societal scrutiny and discrimination. Nongovernmental sources reported generally peaceful interfaith relations, but also reported many cases of negative social attitudes within specific ethnic groups toward individuals who converted from that ethnic group\u2019s dominant religion. The Association of Religious Organizations of Kazakhstan represented minority religious groups\u2019 concerns to the government and provided a forum for consultations among religious groups.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officials engaged with the government to urge respect for religious freedom, including by raising specific cases as well as systemic issues such as the restrictive effect of laws regulating religious practice, criminal penalties for peaceful religious speech, and censorship of religious literature. The U.S.-Kazakhstan Religious Freedom Working Group provided another vehicle to express these concerns.

The SSPDF announced the detention of the suspected officers and started an investigation.  In March, authorities released evangelical pastor Abraham Chol Maketh, head of Cush Vision International Church, after 31 months in prison.  In March, SSPDF troops occupied a church in Central Equatoria State and detained its pastor for allegedly posting a video on social media in 2021 predicting the President and First Vice President would be removed from office.\n\nA Catholic priest and four other individuals remained in prison for the 2021 attempted killing of an Italian priest nominated by the Vatican to be bishop of Rumbek.  In August, according to media reports, the Episcopal Archbishop of Juba called on the government to protect clergy and churches in Bor, Jonglei State, after armed youth militia representing a rival Episcopal faction forced the closure of St. Peter Church.  Senior government officials continued to call on leaders of the factions to resolve their disputes, which had been ongoing for three years.  Media outlets reported on a number of attacks on clerics, including the killing of a church elder and the destruction of several religious buildings, during ethnic clashes on the border of Abyei Special Administrative Area and Warrap State.  In November, ethnic clashes flared again in Warrap State resulting in more than 50 deaths.  In all these cases, religious organizations sought to work in partnership with authorities to stem the violence and create dialogues and peace-building initiatives to resolve ethnic tensions, as well as inter-denominational disputes.\n\nIn February, the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Moderator of the Church of Scotland made a joint ecumenical visit to the country.  The country\u2019s religious institutions generally remained a source of stability in an otherwise unstable environment, according to religious and human rights organizations.  Religious leaders stated a diverse network of Catholic, Protestant, and Muslim domestic and international organizations frequently provided shelter from subnational violence throughout the country.  For example, local and international Catholic and Protestant organizations provided assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) fleeing continued violence in Upper Nile and Unity States at the UN Malakal Protection of Civilians site and at the Bentiu IDP camp.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officials repeatedly raised concerns with government representatives regarding a lack of consistent enforcement of the rule of law, increasing subnational violence, impunity for violent crimes, and reports of human rights abuses and their impact on religious workers.  In addition, through an ongoing series of roundtables hosted by the Ambassador, the embassy promoted religious freedom through discussions and outreach with religious leaders and civil society organizations.  The Ambassador and senior embassy officers regularly visited religious services of many denominations to demonstrate U.S. government support for the role faith-based organizations played in promoting peace and religious freedom in the country.",

Restrictions on freedom of religion remained widespread outside the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR). Activities that promote the normalization of relations with Israel have long been illegal, with penalties as severe as life in prison and the death penalty. The legal code also prohibits Jews from joining the military and holding jobs in the public sector.\n\nThe Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights (IHCHR) reported receiving hundreds of complaints from relatives of persons detained on terrorism charges, citing claims of arrests based on malicious prosecutions, torture, and forced disappearance. Sunni leaders said these abuses frequently targeted Sunnis held on terrorism charges. Sunni political leaders continued to protest the allegedly illegal detention of Sunni Arabs, who represent approximately 90 percent of all prisoners in detention, including 9,000 who received death sentences. International and local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) said the government continued to use the antiterrorism law as a pretext for detaining individuals without due process, most of whom were Sunni Arabs, including those suspected of having links to ISIS. Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) militias frequently threatened members of Sunni and minority communities with terrorism charges to silence their dissent, especially in areas where the militias have taken over local land and economic activities and blocked the return of internally displaced persons (IDPs).\n\nAs in previous years, there were credible reports that government forces, including the Federal Police, the National Security Service (NSS), and the PMF, abused and tortured individuals \u2013 particularly Sunni Arabs \u2013 during arrest, pretrial detention, and after conviction. Yezidis, Christians, and local and international NGOs reported PMF members continued to verbally harass and physically abuse members of religious minority communities. During the year, the government reported minimal progress in locating or rescuing missing Yezidis.\n\nThe Syriac Catholic Church alleged the 30th and 50th PMF Brigades facilitated land sales with the aim of reducing Christian demographics in the Ninewa Plain and had supported Shabaks (a predominantly Shia ethnoreligious group) in seizing at least three Christian properties. Local authorities allegedly authorized illegal approvals for Muslims to increasingly rent property in Christian towns. Yezidi representatives reported Iran-aligned militia groups (IAMGs) maintained private real estate offices to buy Yezidi and Sunni Arab real estate and properties in order to change the demography of the Sinjar district in favor of the Shia community. Only a small number of the country\u2019s population of 400,000 to 500,000 Yezidis had returned to their homes, with Sinjar having an estimated return rate of only 35 percent, including non-Yezidis. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) reported Yezidis comprised 30 percent of approximately 700,000 IDPs present inside and outside camps in the IKR. There have been limited efforts to implement the comprehensive 2020 Agreement on the Restoration of Stability and Normalization in Sinjar (Sinjar Agreement) signed by the government and the KRG, which included expanded reconstruction efforts to support voluntary returns of Yezidis still displaced in the IKR and abroad. Kaka\u2019i (Yarsani) community members again said the federal government\u2019s Shia Endowment seized Kaka\u2019i worship sites in Diyala and Baghdad and later converted them into Shia mosques.\n\nOn July 3, President Abdulatif Jamal Rashid revoked the 2013 presidential decree recognizing Cardinal Louis Sako as the Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church in Iraq. In a statement issued on July 15, Sako called the action \u201cunprecedented,\u201d and \u201cunfair,\u201d stating the president was targeting him and the decision was part of an effort to gain control of church assets. On December 18, the Chaldean Patriarchate announced it would cancel Christmas activities in part in protest against Rashid\u2019s withdrawal of the decree.\n\nAccording to Christian leaders, authorities continued to force Christian families formally registered as Muslim but privately practicing Christianity or another non-Islamic faith to either register their children as Muslims, or to have the children remain undocumented by federal authorities, thereby denying them the ability to legally convert from Islam. Zoroastrian, Kaka\u2019i, and Baha\u2019i Faith leaders again reported their religion was listed as \u201cIslam\u201d on their federal identification cards, a continuing problem reported by members of unrecognized religious groups due to the country\u2019s constitution and personal status law.\n\nAccording to Yezidi activists and officials, Yezidis continued to fear returning to Sinjar because of poor infrastructure, the lack of empowered local government, and the presence of Iran-aligned militia groups as well as the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, which Turkish airstrikes targeted. Several times during the year, Turkish airstrikes struck facilities used by Sinjar Resistance Unit (YBS) Yezidi fighters affiliated with the PKK in Sinjar District. ISIS remnants also threaten the security of Sinjar. In May, the central government\u2019s Martyrs Foundation announced the exhumation of the remains of 605 ISIS victims from mass graves near a prison in Badush in northern Iraq. ISIS fighters had taken the inmates from the prison in 2014 and killed the Shia among the prisoners, according to the Foundation. There were continued reports of societal violence by sectarian armed groups across the country, except in the IKR. Although media and human rights organizations said security conditions in many parts of the country continued to improve, reports of societal violence by Iran-backed militias continued. Members of non-Muslim minority groups reported abductions, threats, pressure, and harassment to force them to observe Islamic customs. In response to desecrations of the Quran in Sweden and Denmark over the summer, large numbers of protesters gathered in Baghdad, and, on one occasion, burned parts of the Swedish embassy.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the Consulate General in Erbil addressed at the highest levels a full range of religious freedom concerns in the country through frequent meetings with senior government officials, including with Prime Minister Mohammed Shiaa al-Sudani, through interagency coordination groups, and in targeted assistance programs for projects including recovery in communities with members of religious minority groups. U.S. delegations, along with embassy and consulate staff, met with members of religious and ethnic groups in Baghdad and Erbil on numerous occasions throughout the year. These groups voiced their concerns regarding the presence of armed groups harassing their community members and promoting and forcing demographic changes; a lack of available resources for stabilization and rehabilitation efforts for internally displaced Christians, Yezidis, and members of other minority groups; and general safety concerns. The Ambassador and other U.S. officials met regularly with national and regional government officials, members of parliament, and parliamentary committees to emphasize the need for the security, full inclusion, tolerance, and protection of the rights of members of minority religious groups. Embassy officials met with Shia, Sunni, Yezidi, Christian, and other religious-group representatives to underscore U.S. support for these communities and to assess the needs and challenges they continued to face.",

The policy removed the requirement for Rastafarian students to cover their hair, which they refer to as \u201clocs.\u201d Rastafarian advocates welcomed the policy, noting decades of what they say was institutionalized discrimination by the state. The government continued compensating individuals from a trust fund it established in 2017 for victims of the 1963 Coral Gardens incident, in which eight persons were killed and hundreds injured in clashes between a Rastafarian farming community and security forces.\n\nWhile Rastafarians continued to report discrimination, they said there was rising societal acceptance and respect for their practices. Local media outlets continued to provide a forum for religious dialogue open to participants from all religious groups.\n\nThe Ambassador engaged various segments of the religious community via numerous activities throughout 2023. Embassy officials also met with a variety of groups, including Christians, Rastafarians, and the Jewish community; they discussed the importance of religious tolerance, social inclusion, and freedom of expression and assembly in relation to religious freedom. In meetings with Rastafarian leaders, embassy officials discussed issues of religious freedom, including discrimination in schools against their children, employment rights, religious use of marijuana, and the wearing of locs.",

The constitution states, \u201cReligious associations shall be separate from the state and shall not interfere in state affairs.\u201d The law restricts Islamic prayer to specific locations, regulates the registration and location of mosques, and prohibits persons younger than 18 from participating in public religious activities. The government\u2019s Committee on Religion, Regulation of Traditions, Celebrations, and Ceremonies (CRA) maintains a broad mandate that includes approving registration of religious associations, construction of houses of worship, participation of children in religious education, and the dissemination of religious literature. The government maintains a list of banned extremist organizations.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies continued to arrest and detain individuals suspected of membership in, or of supporting, prohibited groups. The government arrested 195 suspected members of \u201cextremist\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d organizations in the first half of 2023. Authorities continued a crackdown on Ismaili followers of the Aga Khan in the Gorno-Badakhshon Autonomous Region (GBAO), populated by the ethnically and religiously distinct Pamiri minority. Authorities reportedly seized several properties associated with the Aga Khan. On May 16, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses member Shamil Khakimov, imprisoned since 2019, was released from prison after serving a four-and-a-half-year sentence. Khakimov\u2019s health condition seriously deteriorated during his incarceration. On April 11, the Khatlon Regional Court sentenced imam Abduhannon Usmonov to six years\u2019 imprisonment \u201cfor public calls to extremist activities\u201d and \u201cobstructing basic compulsory education.\u201d In March, a district court in Dushanbe sentenced Muhammadi Rahmatullo, one of the \u201cformer leaders of the Salafis of Tajikistan,\u201d banned in the country, to eight years in prison. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses reported that Farzona Sidikova and Takhmina Avlekulova were arrested and fined while peacefully sharing their personal religious beliefs. On June 14, the Supreme Court ruled that the Pamir Daily News \u2013 an independent news site focusing on the GBAO region where Ismaili Shia adherents are a majority of the population \u2013 was an \u201cextremist organization\u201d and its activities were banned in Tajikistan. Norwegian human rights NGO Forum 18 reported that a 2021 secret decision of the Supreme Court declared Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses an extremist organization and banned its activities throughout the country, upholding an earlier ban in 2007. Jehovah\u2019s Witness appeals of the government ban and attempts to register were again rejected.\n\nThe government continued to select all Friday sermon topics for imams and khatibs. Hanafi Sunni mosques continued to enforce an Ulema Council edict that prohibited women from praying at mosques. There were reports that authorities used mosque closures to pressure young men to register for the draft. Authorities continued to monitor all literature of a religious nature and banned many books and other media throughout the year. The government continued to try to force students studying Islam abroad without government approval to return home and reported that 718 students had thus far been forced to return. Information on the exact time period over which they were returned was not provided in the government disclosure.\n\nThe government also arrested and fined people for teaching Islam to family members at home without a government license to do so. UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief Nazila Ghanea visited the country in April and released a statement urging authorities to adapt and reshape its laws on freedom of religion or belief and \u201cto look beyond the singular concern with extremism, terrorism, and incitement and to open imaginations to positive contributions of religion to a harmonious and rich public life.\u201d\n\nIndividuals outside government continued to express reluctance to discuss issues such as societal respect for religious diversity, including abuses or discrimination based on religious belief, due to fear of government harassment. According to members of religious minority groups, Muslims who converted to non-Muslim religions usually faced social disapproval from family and relatives. On social media, there was significant criticism of Ismaili Shia Muslims and Zoroastrians. Traditional state and private media reportedly did not negatively portray or target minority religious groups.\n\nIn meetings throughout the year with government officials, the Ambassador and other embassy officers continued to raise concerns regarding restrictions on minors\u2019 and women\u2019s participation in religious services, the situation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in the country, and restrictions on the religious education of youth. Embassy representatives raised the registration difficulties faced by non-Islamic religious organizations, the provisions in the freedom of conscience law, and the requirements for religious organizations to report certain activities to the government. Embassy officers again sought amnesty for prisoners of conscience, including the release of Shamil Khakimov. Embassy officials discussed religious freedom issues with civil society, NGO representatives, and religious leaders during the year.\n\nThe country has been designated as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom. On December 29, 2023, the Secretary of State redesignated Tajikistan as a CPC and announced a waiver of the required sanctions that accompany designation in the \u201cimportant national interest of the United States.\u201d",

morality, or health.\u00a0 Ten of 28 states have laws restricting religious conversions for all faiths.\u00a0 Some of these states also impose penalties specifically against forced religious conversions for the purpose of marriage.\n\nDuring the year, some members of religious minority groups challenged the government\u2019s ability and willingness to protect them from violence, investigate crimes against members of religious minority groups, and protect their freedom of religion or belief.\u00a0 In February, a crowd of 20,000 Christians gathered in New Delhi to protest increasing violence against them and request greater protections for the Christian community.\u00a0 In March, a group of 93 former senior civil servants wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing concerns regarding \u201ccontinued harassment\u201d of Christians in particular by government officials and political party leaders associated with the government.\u00a0 Christians and Muslims were arrested under laws banning forced religious conversions, which religious groups said in some cases were used to harass and imprison members of religious minority groups on false and fabricated charges or for lawful religious practices.\u00a0 In some cases, Christian groups said local police aided mobs that disrupted worship services over accusations of conversion activities or stood by while mobs attacked Christians and then arrested the victims on conversion charges.\n\nIn December, Parliament approved new criminal laws that included provisions to criminalize making false promises and concealing one\u2019s identity to sexually exploit a woman, including for marriage.\u00a0 Media commentators said the new laws could be used to punish Muslim men purportedly seeking to marry non-Muslim women to convert them to Islam.\u00a0 Opponents said the new laws were unnecessary and the strict penalties were out of line with lighter penalties given for more serious offenses.\u00a0 Prime Minister Modi reiterated calls to enact a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) at the national level as called for in the constitution instead of a system of separate personal laws for religious communities.\u00a0 Muslim, Sikh, Christian, and tribal leaders and some state government officials opposed the initiative on the grounds it was part of a project to turn the country into a \u201cHindu Rashtra\u201d (a Hindu Nation).\u00a0 Some UCC proponents, including opposition politicians, said a UCC would promote greater equality, including for women, by preventing polygamy or inequitable inheritance within personal religious laws.\n\nSome government and political officials made comments and took actions in support of religious tolerance during the year.\u00a0 In April, Christian leaders welcomed Prime Minister Modi\u2019s visit to the Sacred Heart Cathedral in New Delhi, which many in the Christian community stated they viewed as a gesture of solidarity.\u00a0 During his state visit to the United States in June, Prime Minister Modi said, \u201cregardless of caste, creed, religion, gender \u2013 there is absolutely no space for any discrimination [in my government].\u201d\u00a0 In December, Prime Minister Modi hosted approximately 100 Christian representatives from different denominations at his official residence and praised the contributions of the country\u2019s Christians, but more than 3,200 individuals from the Christian community dissociated themselves from the meeting, citing growing anti-minority attacks and anti-minority hate speech by certain government officials.\u00a0 In April, President Droupadi Murmu met with a Christian delegation to discuss attacks against Christians in the country.\u00a0 In April, the government published a research paper that said there was no evidence of religious discrimination in the government\u2019s provision of public services.\u00a0 In September, the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) met with Christian leaders and said it would address cases of persecution of Christians.\n\nInternational nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) such as Human Rights Watch (HRW), however, stated that the \u201cactions and statements by members and supporters of his (Modi\u2019s) BJP party [Bharatiya Janata Party] contradicted\u201d government officials\u2019 positive statements.\u00a0 They further stated that the government should investigate and prosecute those responsible for carrying out violence against members of minority groups.\n\nThe National Crimes Record Bureau reported 272 instances of communal violence in 2022 compared with 378 in 2021(most recent data).\u00a0 Attacks on members of religious minority groups, including killings, assaults, and intimidation, occurred in various states throughout the year, including cases of \u201ccow vigilantism\u201d based on allegations that Muslim men were participating in cow slaughter or trade in beef.\u00a0 There were also attacks on religious leaders, disruption of Christian and Muslim worship services, vandalism of religious minorities\u2019 houses of worship, and violence between religious groups.\u00a0 Islamic groups in Jammu and Kashmir also reportedly attacked non-Muslims during the year.\n\nIn December, the United Christian Forum (UCF) reported 731 attacks on Christians in the year, compared with 599 such incidents in 2022.\u00a0 The UCF data by state showed the most incidents in Uttar Pradesh (301) and Chhattisgarh (152).\u00a0 In April, the government told the Supreme Court said that the UCF exaggerated claims of attacks against Christians to create a false narrative.\u00a0 In July, the UCF\u2019s national coordinator said, \u201cThe government data (on violence against Christians) downplays the severity of the situation.\u201d\n\nDuring violence in Manipur that started on May 3 between minority Christian Kuki and majority Hindu Meitei ethnic groups, Hindu and Christian places of worship were destroyed, as well as two synagogues of the small Bnei Menashe Jewish community.\u00a0 The Indigenous Tribal Leaders\u2019 Forum and international media said that at least 253 churches were burned down, more than 200 persons were killed and more than 60,000 displaced due to the violence.\u00a0 Most of the attacks against religious sites were reported to have taken place in the first few days of the conflict, when the interethnic violence was at its peak; the eventual deployment of security forces reduced widespread violence although incidences of violence continued through the end of the year.\u00a0 Because religion and ethnicity were closely linked in this clash, it was difficult to categorize specific acts of violence as being solely based on religious identity, but there were some reports of Meitei Hindus attacking churches that served Meitei Christians, who also reportedly faced pressure to convert from Christianity.\u00a0 One local Meitei Christian leader said that the Meitei Christians had been \u201cattacked from both sides.\u201d\u00a0 The Supreme Court criticized the failure of the central government and the Manipur state government to halt the violence especially in the early stages of the conflict, and appointed officials to investigate incidents of violence, ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and rebuild homes and places of worship.\n\nPublic celebrations of Hindu festivals sometimes resulted in communal violence, particularly when they included processions through Muslim-majority areas.\u00a0 Media and NGOs reported that these processions were led by the BJP and affiliated Hindu nationalist groups, including Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP).\u00a0 In communal violence in several states, including West Bengal, Bihar, and Haryana nine persons were killed, dozens injured, and mosques, a madrassah and other buildings destroyed or damaged.\u00a0 Police arrested several hundred persons in connection with the violence, according to NGOs and local sources.\u00a0 In Haryana, authorities demolished 1,208 structures in the area where there was communal violence, with civil society organizations and international NGOs accusing authorities of largely targeting Muslim homes and shops.\u00a0 A state official said the structures belonged to persons arrested in the violence, and that the buildings were used by rioters or were encroaching on government land.\u00a0 The Punjab and Haryana High Court subsequently ordered authorities to halt the demolitions and the Supreme Court also condemned hate speech and calls for economic boycotts against the Muslim community.\u00a0 The Organization of Islamic Cooperation expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d regarding violence and vandalism against Muslims in several states, which it said reflected \u201csystemic targeting of the Muslim community in India.\u201d\n\nSome public figures made remarks that members of religious minority groups and Hindus said were inflammatory.\u00a0 Christians and Muslims in the Bastar area of Chhattisgarh petitioned local authorities to take action against local leaders of the BJP, the VHP, and other organizations that called for an embargo of Christian and Muslim businesses at a rally on April 10.\u00a0 Following the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, international media reported \u201ca flood of disinformation\u201d on social media purporting that the country was threatened by its Muslim population, particularly in Muslim-majority areas.\u00a0 In October, speakers at a conference organized by the Hindu nationalist umbrella organization Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS) said Hindus were \u201craising their voice(s) against the injustice they face\u201d because they were being \u201ctargeted\u201d by other groups with charges of making hate speech around the country.\n\nIn a joint statement during Prime Minister Modi\u2019s state visit to Washington in June, the U.S. and Indian governments reaffirmed \u201ctheir shared values of freedom, democracy, human rights, inclusion, pluralism, and equal opportunities for all citizens.\u201d\n\nDuring the year, senior U.S. officials continued to raise concerns about religious freedom issues with their Indian counterparts.\u00a0 During his visit in April, the Secretary of State also discussed developments in religious freedom with women leaders.\u00a0 In July, the Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights met with civil society organizations and underscored the U.S. commitment to freedom of religion or belief and freedom of expression.\u00a0 Throughout the year, the Ambassador, embassy, and consulate officials, the Assistant Secretary of State and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, and other official U.S. visitors engaged with government officials and members of religious communities, including representatives of the Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh faiths, to discuss the importance of religious freedom and pluralism, the value of interfaith dialogue, and the operating environment for faith-based organizations.\n\n",

The law states government officials may prohibit the activity of a religious association for violating public order or engaging in \u201cextremist activity.\u201d The law allows the government to criminalize a broad spectrum of activities as extremist but does not precisely define extremism. A law enacted in 2022 authorizes creation of a confidential database of materials defined as extremist and a \u201cunified register\u201d of individuals in organizations defined as terrorist or extremist. Another 2022 law requires certain organizations, including religious groups and individuals, to publicly identify themselves as foreign agents, which critics say is intended to discredit them. The law identifies Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism as the country\u2019s four \u201ctraditional\u201d religions and recognizes the special role of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC).\n\nReligious groups and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) again reported authorities investigated, detained, imprisoned, tortured, and physically abused persons and seized their property because of their religious belief or affiliation or membership in groups designated \u201cextremist,\u201d \u201cterrorist,\u201d or \u201cundesirable.\u201d Targeted groups included Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatars, Hizb ut-Tahrir, Tablighi Jamaat, followers of Turkish Muslim theologian Said Nursi, the Church of Scientology, Falun Gong, and multiple evangelical Protestant groups. In one example, the leader of a Saint Petersburg Church of Scientology received a sentence of six-and-a-half years in prison for incitement to hatred or enmity by an organized group and creation of an extremist community. According to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses representatives, as of December 18, 115 individuals were imprisoned under the charge of extremism. During the year, courts sentenced numerous Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to lengthy prison terms on charges of participating in an extremist organization and convicted many for conducting or participating in religious services. Members of Hizb ut-Tahrir, which describes itself as an international Islamic political organization seeking to unite Muslims under a single caliphate through nonviolent means, received lengthy prison sentences. Authorities also undertook prosecutions of followers of Said Nursi.\n\nAccording to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), some ROC priests and members of other religious communities quietly opposed the country\u2019s war on Ukraine, fearing fines or prohibition against performing their religious duties if they made their views public. ROC Patriarch Kirill continued to express support of government actions in Ukraine. In September, the Washington Post reported that President Vladimir Putin, referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stated, \u201cThe Western masters put a person at the head of modern Ukraine (who is) an ethnic Jew, with Jewish roots, with Jewish origins\u201d to cover up \u201cthe antihuman essence that is the foundation \u2026 of the modern Ukrainian state\u201d and \u201cthe glorification of Nazism.\u201d\n\nDuring the year, the Ministry of Justice continued to deliberate whether the Jewish Agency for Israel should be designated as a foreign agent. The government continued to open criminal cases against members of smaller religious groups for what it called illegal missionary work and the distribution of extremist materials. The government continued to grant privileges to the ROC not accorded to other religious groups. In August, the government ordered the dissolution of the SOVA Center for Information Analysis, a Moscow-based human rights organization focusing on freedom of religion and belief, among other human rights. The organization\u2019s leaders subsequently created the SOVA Research Center (SOVA Center) to replace it.\n\nThere were widespread reports Russia\u2019s armed forces, Russia-led forces, and Russian occupation authorities in Ukraine engaged in numerous abuses of religious freedom (see the Department of State\u2019s 2023 International Religious Freedom Report for Ukraine).\n\nThere were reports of societal violence and vandalism with antisemitic overtones, as well as increasing reports of openly antisemitic rhetoric entering the country\u2019s mainstream media. The SOVA Center reported several incidents of vandalism of Jewish religious sites as well as other incidents of religiously motivated vandalism. On October 28, in reaction to Israeli military actions directed at Hamas in Gaza following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack, hundreds of persons broke past security at the Dagestan airport to protest the arrival of an Israeli El Al passenger flight, with some shouting antisemitic slogans. In another incident, protestors mobbed a hotel after they heard Jews were lodged there.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador and other embassy representatives and Department of State officials advocated greater religious freedom in the country, highlighting the government\u2019s misuse of the law on extremism to restrict the peaceful activities of minority religious groups. The embassy also used social media to disseminate messages advocating religious freedom. In recent years, the government has expelled U.S. diplomats and prohibited the embassy from employing Russian and third-country nationals. In addition, the government engaged in extreme repression of civil society groups and dramatically curtailed freedom of expression following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and sought to stigmatize and criminalize interactions between its nationals and foreign governments. For these reasons, the embassy\u2019s outreach to the religious community was constrained. Department of State officials continued to monitor the situation of U.S. citizens working with religious institutions and organizations in the country to determine whether authorities were improperly targeting them for their faith or religious work.\n\nSince 2021, Russia has been designated as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as amended for having engaged in and tolerating systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom. On December 29, 2023, the Secretary of State redesignated Russia as a CPC and identified the following sanctions that accompanied the designation: the existing ongoing sanctions issued for individuals identified pursuant to section 404(a)(2) of the Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 and section 11 of the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014, as amended by Section 228 of the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, pursuant to section 402(c)(5) of the act.",

While data were unavailable, messages on social media by congregation members suggested a significant increase in donation pledges during the year, compared with 2022.

By law, the government gives financial support to four of these faith communities, but not to VUSH or other religious groups. In December 2022, the Assembly (parliament) amended legislation for the restitution of property, including religious groups\u2019 property that was confiscated by the former Communist government. The legislation requires groups to petition the Agency for the Treatment of Property (ATP) or the courts for restitution, establishes compensation guidelines for property that could not be restituted, and sets a deadline of December 31, 2024, for the ATP to determine and distribute proper compensation.\n\nThe Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 2022 appeal of a lower court ruling that the government was not obligated to enter into an agreement similar to those obtained by the five main faith communities remained pending at year\u2019s end; the lower court decision left the group subject to some fees and taxes. In May, a court ruled that an evangelical Christian pastor was not guilty of hate speech for comments he had made in 2021 against proposed amendments to the family code that would change \u201cfather and mother\u201d to \u201cparent 1 and parent 2,\u201d which he stated went against biblical teachings. The government continued the process of legalizing buildings constructed by religious groups without government approval, legalizing 47 such buildings during the year, compared with 97 in 2022. The State Agency of the Cadaster (SAC), courts, and the ATP continued to process property claims for restitution, compensation, and registration of property seized under the former Communist regime, but the five main religious communities continued to express concern over delays by these institutions, citing ATP\u2019s slow processing times, changing legislation, and delayed court proceedings. In September, the AMC challenged the December 2022 property legislation amendment in the Constitutional Court, citing concerns with the compensation formula and the inability of owners to exercise the right to property or just compensation. In November, the ATP paused implementation of the law pending a ruling from the Constitutional Court on the AMC\u2019s lawsuit. The AOC again said that despite numerous requests, the government had not returned all sacred objects, relics, icons, and archives confiscated during the Communist regime.\n\nA June report by a Council of Europe advisory body cited Albania\u2019s tradition of interreligious tolerance but stated that a lack of data made it difficult for authorities to design targeted measures to assist national minorities. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses pointed to negative media coverage of the group, which they said stemmed from its lack of status as an officially recognized religious organization. According to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, criminal and civil defamation cases they filed against four media companies in 2021 remained pending in court. The Interfaith Council, a forum for leaders from the five main religious communities, held several meetings and hosted events to promote interfaith dialogue and combat radicalization and violent extremism related to religion.\n\nThe U.S. embassy urged government officials to accelerate the handling of property claims and to return religious groups\u2019 buildings and other property confiscated during the Communist era. Embassy officials met with representatives of religious communities to discuss interfaith and governmental relations and the problems they faced regarding property legalization and restitution. Embassy-sponsored programs, including those that engaged youth from minority religious communities, focused on developing community inclusivity and cohesiveness, promoting women\u2019s empowerment in religious communities, and emphasizing the compatibility of religious faith and democracy.",

Christian groups continued to report their primary concern remained the inability to acquire burial plots and the lack of a governmental process to do so.\n\nOpen Doors reported some Buddhist monks opposed the presence of Christians, sometimes putting pressure on them to reconvert.  According to the report, deviation from traditional Buddhist beliefs was regarded as disrupting culturally valued social harmony; family and community members also put pressure on converts to return to Buddhism.  Open Doors also reported that non-Christian individuals sometimes disrupted meetings of Christians and questioned the legality of their meeting.  Some Christian pastors reported societal discrimination against Christians had faded significantly over the years and was largely a problem of the past, although they said some converts experienced familial pressure to return to Buddhism.\n\nThe United States does not have formal diplomatic relations with Bhutan; the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi oversees unofficial bilateral relations.

In both instances, Hindus said Muslims threw stones at their procession; Muslims said Hindus attacked mosques. Several persons were injured in both clashes, and some shops and houses were set on fire in one incident. Authorities imposed curfews to control the situations. In Lumbini Province in October, Muslims burned tires and blocked traffic to protest a social media message they viewed as offensive to Islam; a peaceful rally there the next day turned violent when Hindus and Muslims threw stones and bottles at each other. Some police and protesters were injured before police stepped in and authorities imposed a curfew. On August 30, a self-described Hindu nationalist group vandalized four churches in Lumbini Province. The next day, a mob assaulted and smeared ink on two Christians pastors.

Multiple Christian sources again said that inflammatory material appeared on social media, and several Catholic and Protestant sources also cited a rise in what they termed anti-Christian propaganda, misinformation, and discriminatory and divisive religious content on traditional media. The NGO Persecution.org reported that interfaith leaders convened in Kathmandu on June 5-6 with government officials and ethnic minority group representatives to discuss the state of religious freedom in the country and steps to protect it.\n\nThe Ambassador and visiting U.S. government representatives expressed concerns to political leaders and the Ministries of Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs regarding restrictions on the country\u2019s Tibetan community.

The Africa Center for Justice and Peace Studies, expressing concern regarding increasing SAF and RSF violations of freedom of worship, reported in July that 16 mosques were partially destroyed, four churches were raided and looted, and worshippers were denied entry and/or forced to convert to Islam since the outbreak of armed conflict.  The report also cited deaths and injuries to worshippers.  MorningStar News reported that SAF forces shelled a Sudanese Presbyterian Evangelical Church (SPEC) in Omdurman on November 1, leaving the building in ruins and destroying everything inside, including Bibles and prayer books.  MorningStar News also reported shelling on November 3 of the Mariam Home building in Al-Shajjara belonging to the Comboni Catholic missionary order that resulted in injury to five nuns and several children.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of conflict in April, individuals, religious leaders, and local media stressed the impact of the conflict on local civilians, including the inability to attend services, prayer meetings, or other gatherings due to frequent attacks on churches and mosques, and increased shelling and destruction of houses of worship.  Local news and human rights organizations stated they believed the RSF and allied militias targeted churches specifically due to the belief that they possessed gold and other valuables.\n\nEmbassy officials began the year organizing a \u201creligious freedom iftar\u201d bringing together more than 70 individuals of various faiths to promote religious diversity and freedoms.  Following this event, embassy officials stressed in subsequent meetings the importance of identifying measures to advance religious tolerance, such as laws that promote religious tolerance and outreach campaigns among the various religious groups.  After the fighting broke out in April and the embassy suspended local operations and relocated staff to neighboring countries, embassy officials engaged with religious leaders, faith-based groups, and civil society organizations, including SPEC, the Sudan Council of Churches, the Evangelical Church of Bahri, and the Catholic Archbishop of Khartoum, to discuss ways to end the conflict between RSF and SAF, facilitate humanitarian access to those in need, and return to a civilian government that protects religious freedom.",

In June, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship (MFA) appointed Ambassador Fabiana Loguzzo as the country\u2019s first special envoy to combat antisemitism. The National Congress passed a law declaring July 18 a permanent day of national mourning in remembrance of the 1994 Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) bombing and a law declaring October 31 as the National Day of Evangelical and Protestant Churches. On December 10, President Javier Milei participated in an interreligious service with leaders from Catholic, evangelical Christian, Anglican, Jewish, and Muslim communities as part of his inauguration day activities.\n\nDuring the year, media, government authorities, and civil society organizations reported incidents of discrimination based on religion in the forms of violence, hate speech, and misinformation. Members of the Jewish and Muslim communities both reported an increase in antisemitic and anti-Muslim actions, respectively, after the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel. The Delegation of Argentine Jewish Associations (DAIA) cited 427 incidents of antisemitism in its annual report for 2022, compared with 490 incidents in 2021. Approximately 86 percent of the threats and antisemitic comments occurred in social media, compared with 76 percent in 2021. According to media reports and the Islam for Peace Institute, members of the Muslim community continued to experience incidents of religious discrimination such as religious slurs and intolerance. Interreligious groups such as the Interreligious Committee for Peace in Argentina continued to work to promote tolerance.\n\nU.S. embassy officials met with senior government officials, including the MFA Secretariat of Worship and human rights office, to promote respect for religious freedom and counteract religious discrimination. The Ambassador promoted the importance of religious tolerance with a diverse, high-profile group of religious and secular leaders when he hosted the embassy\u2019s second iftar in April and encouraged the government to appoint a special envoy for antisemitism. On July 18, the Ambassador and other embassy officials attended the annual commemoration to mourn the victims of the 1994 AMIA terrorist attack. The Ambassador also held multiple meetings with AMIA, DAIA, and other religious groups throughout the year. On October 9, the Ambassador joined Jewish organizations in Buenos Aires to march in solidarity with Israel in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack against Israel. Embassy officials supported interfaith cooperation and universal respect for freedom of religion through public statements and social media postings as well as in meetings with religious groups.",

The criminal code effectively prohibits conversion from Islam.\n\nThe Government of National Unity (GNU) exerted limited control outside Tripoli and relied heavily on armed groups to remain in power.  The Tripoli-based Internal Security Agency (ISA), nominally under the authority of the Presidential Council (PC) but aligned to GNU Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dabaiba, arrested numerous individuals for Christian proselytizing and conversion from Islam to Christianity.  The ISA posted video \u201cconfessions\u201d online, allegedly obtained under duress.  The Special Deterrence Force, an armed group that reports to the PC and whose senior leadership adheres to the Salafist Madkhali strain of Islam, arrested and detained individuals for violating Islamic law.\n\nIn May, a court in Misrata handed down sentences to 37 persons convicted in the beheading of 21 foreign Coptic Christians in Sirte in 2015, with 23 receiving the death penalty and 14 receiving prison terms.  In May, the GNU General Authority for Endowments and Islamic Affairs (GAEIA) established the \u201cGuardians of Virtue\u201d to protect Islamic values; critics compared it to a \u201csecret police\u201d organization.  The GNU GAEIA also issued orders against Sufi traditional celebrations of the Prophet\u2019s birthday in September, which typically includes dancing, beating drums, and chanting.  Following the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel in October and the Israeli response, the head of the GNU GAEIA requested imams deliver a Friday sermon warning Muslims of \u201cthe danger of Jews.\u201d\n\nHybrid armed actors (armed groups that are affiliated with the state and at times cooperate with it, while at other times compete against it) and nonstate actors continued to operate and control territory throughout the country, including in Tripoli and in Benghazi.  There were reports of armed groups restricting religious practices, enforcing compliance with their interpretations of sharia, and targeting those viewed as violating their standards.  The nonstate actor known as the Libyan National Army (LNA) controlled territory in the east and south, while the eastern \u201cGovernment of National Stability\u201d (GNS), which is affiliated with the LNA and rivals the GNU, claimed authority but showed limited ability to control territory.  According to media reports, elements of the Madkhali-Salafist movement affiliated with the LNA continued to suppress activities not sanctioned by their strict interpretation of Islam.\n\nAccording to several Christian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), Muslims who converted to another religion faced intense pressure to return to Islam.  Sources also reported converts to other religions as well as atheists and agnostics faced threats of violence or dismissal from employment and hostility from their families and communities because of their beliefs.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy to Libya operated remotely from Tunis, Tunisia, and U.S. officials made regular trips to the country.  Embassy representatives discussed religious freedom with a variety of local and national leaders.  To address religious freedom issues, embassy officials met with human rights organizations, including Middle East Concern (MEC), the Arab Organization for Human Rights \u2013 Libya (AOHRL), and Human Rights Watch, as well as clergy, activists, and researchers.  The embassy funded a program to counter disinformation and hate speech.  The embassy also partnered with local NGOs from Tripoli, Misrata, Benghazi, Zawiya, Ubari, Qatrun, and Sabha to implement media literacy training and social media campaigns aimed at curbing hate speech and disinformation.",

According to a council member, a bill passed in 2022 prescribing restorative justice remedies, such as counseling and community service, instead of prison sentences for possession of fewer than 30 grams (1.06 ounces) of cannabis also discriminated against Rastafarians because the law hindered their constitutional right to freely practice their religion.  In March, the government reconstituted the ERC, appointing 10 new commissioners.  In September, the ERC assessed reports that a fast-food restaurant had sold fried chicken in paper bags labelled with the Hindu religious \u2018OM\u2019 symbol.

The government reportedly continued to execute, torture, arrest, and physically abuse individuals for their religious activities. Despite some relaxation beginning in the middle of the year, COVID-19 restrictions on travel to and from the country further reduced information regarding conditions, making details on cases of abuse and estimates involving religious groups difficult to verify. In April, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported authorities had initiated a nationwide \u201cantisuperstition campaign\u201d targeting a range of \u201csuperstitious practices\u201d such as fortune telling.\n\nIn a 2021 report, the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Korea Future described the government\u2019s denial of religious freedom as absolute and cited multiple incidents of arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and inhuman treatment, and executions of persons because of their religious belief. Officials principally targeted Christians and followers of Shamanism. Of the 244 victims documented in the report, 150 adhered to Shamanism, 91 adhered to Christianity, one to Cheondoism, and one to other beliefs. NGOs and escapees said the government often arrested or otherwise punished family members of Christians. The NGO Open Doors USA (ODUSA) estimated authorities held 50,000 to 70,000 citizens in prison for being Christian. ODUSA stated that Christians experienced persecution that was \u201cviolent and intense\u201d and that \u201clife for Christians \u2026 is a constant cauldron of pressure; capture or death is only a mistake away.\u201d In its annual report, ODUSA cited roundups of Christians from underground churches followed by executions and imprisonments as among the most serious abuses. In an October 2020 white paper, the NGO Database Center for North Korean Human Rights (NKDB) reported 1,411 cases of religious persecution by authorities, including 126 killings and 94 disappearances, based on reports of escapees from the DPRK between 2007 and July 2020 and other sources. A 2022 report by the International Bar Association stated Christians in detention centers were consistently subjected to more severe and protracted torture than non-Christians, citing numerous examples of severe physical abuse and killings.\n\nA small number of officially registered religious institutions, including churches, existed in the country, particularly in Pyongyang, although according to travelers who were able to visit prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the institutions operated under tight state control and functioned largely as showpieces for foreigners. The government encouraged all citizens to report anyone engaged in unauthorized religious activity or in possession of religious material. There were reports of private Christian religious activity, although the existence of underground churches and the scope of underground religious networks remained difficult to quantify. Escapee accounts indicated religious practitioners often concealed their activities from family members, neighbors, coworkers, and others due to fear of being branded as disloyal and concerns their activities would be reported to authorities. Some defectors and NGOs reported unapproved religious materials were available clandestinely. A Korea Future report in 2022 stated the state ideology of \u201cKimilsungism-Kimjongilism\u201d (adherence to the teachings of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il) had many hallmarks of religion, and the state presents the two leaders as \u201cextraordinary beings\u201d in official materials and authorized texts.\n\nThe U.S. government does not have diplomatic relations with the DPRK. The United States cosponsored a resolution adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly in December that again condemned the country\u2019s \u201clong-standing and ongoing systematic, widespread, and gross violations of human rights\u201d and expressed very serious concern regarding abuses, including \u201cin some instances, summary executions of individuals exercising their freedom of opinion and expression, religion or belief.\u201d The U.S. government raised concerns regarding religious freedom in the country in other multilateral forums and in bilateral discussions with other governments, particularly those with diplomatic relations with the country.\n\nSince 2001, the DPRK has been designated as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom. On December 29, 2023, the Secretary of State redesignated the country as a CPC and identified the following sanctions that accompanied the designation: the existing ongoing restrictions to which North Korea is subject, pursuant to sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Jackson-Vanik Amendment) pursuant to section 402(c)(5) of the act.",

The government also has authority to approve the appointment of religious leaders in non-Islamic religious communities.\n\nLocal human rights groups and detainees said the government continued to physically abuse, temporarily hold incommunicado, arrest, and imprison religious activists, and that many arrests and convictions of religious figures, including on drug possession charges, were politically motivated. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and international observers estimated the government arrested hundreds of activists and Shia Muslims whom the government considered \u201cnonconforming.\u201d Many of these arrests occurred in conjunction with the country\u2019s escalated tensions with Iran, which included an attack on Azerbaijan\u2019s embassy in Tehran in January and the attempted assassination in March in Azerbaijan of a member of parliament who was known for his criticism of Iran. The government charged most of the detainees with drug possession, but many of those arrested said they believed their arrests were related to their online support for Shia clerics in Iran, fundraising for prisoners of conscience, or participation in religious pilgrimages to Iran. Several detainees accused police of planting drugs on them and threatening to rape them if they did not confess. Throughout the year, authorities arrested \u201cnonconforming\u201d Shia individuals who met in public for religious observances.\n\nThe NGO Union for Freedom of Political Prisoners of Azerbaijan stated 183 individuals were imprisoned for their religious practices or religiously based opposition to the government as of year\u2019s end, compared with 22 at the end of 2022. This group included 59 members of the unregistered Shia group Muslim Unity Movement (MUM), which the government considered an illegal organization that it said incited national and religious enmity and accused of receiving funding from Iran. MUM members continued to report authorities physically abused them while in custody, including subjecting them to beatings and sexual assault. Some civil society organizations and human rights activists said they considered the incarceration of MUM members to be politically motivated. On September 28, a Baku court sentenced Iranian-trained Shia imam Sardar Babayev to 17 years\u2019 imprisonment for treason in a case human rights activists said was motivated by Babayev\u2019s religious activities.\n\nIn June, the Council of Europe\u2019s European Commission against Racism and Intolerance stated its ongoing concern over the imprisonment of conscientious objectors and encouraged authorities to take necessary legislative actions to allow alternative service, as stipulated in the constitution. On June 8, Jehovah\u2019s Witness and conscientious objector Seymur Mammadov lost his final appeal before the Supreme Court of his conviction and one-year suspended sentence. At year\u2019s end, the SCWRA had registered two new religious communities, both Muslim. In June, the SCWRA reported since 2022 it had dismissed 181 Muslim clerics from their positions. Previous statements from officials had noted some of the removals were due to \u201cIranian infiltration.\u201d\n\nLocal experts on religious affairs, religious leaders, and civil society representatives said the general public continued to show tolerance of, and in some cases financially supported, minority religious groups they viewed as \u201ctraditional\u201d (i.e., those considered historically present in the country), including Jews, Russian Orthodox, and Catholics. According to the same sources, some individuals viewed religious groups that had less of a historical presence in the country with suspicion and mistrust.\n\nThe Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires and other U.S. embassy officers continued their engagement with government officials to advocate the release of individuals that civil society and religious groups said were imprisoned for their religious beliefs. Embassy officers also expressed concern to the government regarding the large-scale arrests of \u201cnonconforming\u201d Shia Muslims in the country. The Charg\u00e9 and embassy officers urged government officials to address longstanding problems involving the registration process for smaller religious communities and to implement a civilian alternative to military service for conscientious objectors, as stipulated in the constitution. Embassy officers and visiting Department of State officials discussed with government policy makers laws impacting the free exercise of religion and the need to protect religious and cultural heritage sites in newly returned territories. The Charg\u00e9 and other embassy officers met regularly with representatives of registered and unregistered religious groups and civil society to discuss religious freedom in the country.\n\nOn December 29, 2023, in accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as amended, the Secretary of State placed Azerbaijan on the Special Watch List for having engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom.",

The law requires all religious groups to apply to the MOJ for official registration. By law, membership in or association with an unregistered group is a crime. The penal code stipulates a minimum sentence of six months\u2019 incarceration, a fine, or both for individuals who attempt to conscientiously object to military service or prevent minors from attending public school, including those whose objections are based on their religious beliefs. It also imposes sentences of up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment on persons receiving funding from foreign organizations or for financing activities considered to be directed against the state or its constitutional order. The family code states parents have the responsibility to instill in children love for the homeland, respect for its symbols, and respect for government authorities.\n\nIn its annual Watch List, the Christian nongovernmental organization (NGO) Open Doors reported an increase in government persecution of Christians from 2019 to 2023, including use of repressive tactics against religious leaders and activists opposing CCP ideology through arrests, exile, arbitrary fines, surveillance, denials of licenses, religious visas, freedom of movement, and physical and mental abuse. According to CSW\u2019s (formerly known as Christian Solidarity Worldwide) annual report released in February and covering 2022, there were 657 violations of freedom of religion or belief compared with 272 reported violations in 2021. Pastor Lorenzo Rosales Fajardo, sentenced in 2022 to seven years in prison on charges of disrespect, assault, criminal incitement, and public disorder, remained in prison at year\u2019s end. Free Yorubas of Cuba (Free Yorubas) leaders and married couple Donaida Perez Paseiro and Loreto Hernandez Garcia also remained in prison through year\u2019s end.

The government continued to pressure regime critics \u2013 including religious leaders \u2013 to self-exile. In November, a multidenominational group of church leaders, the Alliance of Christians of Cuba (ACC), issued a public declaration calling for political and religious reform, including for the protection of freedom of religion or belief. Religious groups said the ORA and the MOJ continued to deny official registration to certain religious groups and failed to respond to long-pending applications, such as those for Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Church of Jesus Christ).\n\nDuring the year, there were reports of incidents of theft and vandalism of churches, which one cleric described as part of the \u201cgrowing wave of social indiscipline and societal violence against religious institutions.\u201d In October, representatives of Afro-Cuban, Muslim, Jewish religious communities and Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, and evangelical Protestant Christian groups participated in two religious freedom roundtables. State security detained a few participants when traveling to the event, including Pastor Alejandro Hernandez Cepero.

In February, a Bamako court sentenced the leader of Kemetism, Fakoly Doumbia, to one year\u2019s imprisonment, including eight months suspended, for \u201coffenses of a religious nature capable of causing disturbance to public order.\u201d  The Ministry of Religious Affairs, Worship, and Customs (MARCC) supported the High Islamic Council (HCI)\u2019s efforts to organize conferences and workshops on countering violent extremism.  In collaboration with the HCI and representatives from Catholic and Protestant churches, MARCC published preaching guidelines in January aimed at combating violent extremism.  MARCC also renewed a training program for imams with the Moroccan government.\n\nIndividuals affiliated with organizations the government labels as terrorists, including organizations designated as such by the U.S. government, continued to use violence and launch attacks on civilians, security forces, peacekeepers, and others perceived as not adhering to the terrorists\u2019 interpretation of Islam.  According to media reports, on July 9, individuals affiliated with ISIS-Sahel, amputated the hands and feet of two men accused of collecting taxes falsely claimed to be on behalf of ISIS-Sahel in the local market of Inchinanane in the Menaka Region.  Media outlets reported that on November 26, German Catholic priest Hans-Joachim Lohre was released after being abducted by Jama\u2019at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qa\u2019ida affiliated group, in November 2022.  Groups identified by authorities as extremist organizations continued to target and close government schools, ordering the transformation of some of them into Quranic schools.  In the Mopti and Segou Regions, groups the authorities identified as extremist reportedly continued observing verbal \u201cpeace\u201d agreements with local populations, with stipulations that permitted the local population to move freely throughout the area and practice their faith within prescribed limits in exchange for not challenging the groups\u2019 territorial claims.  Representatives of Caritas, the charitable arm of the Catholic Church, said extremist groups continued to force women of all faiths to wear veils in some parts of the region of Mopti.  Caritas characterized these developments as signs of the growing influence of extremist interpretations of Islam in Mopti, which they believed threatened the Christian community.\n\nSeveral influential imams, civil society organizations, and transition government officials continued to caution against divisive language that associated certain ethnic groups with groups of violent extremists motivated by religious ideology.  The youth branch of the umbrella Fulani civil society organization, Tabital Pulaaku, held a press conference in July warning against generalizations associating the Fulani ethnic group with terrorists.  Muslim, Protestant, and Catholic leaders jointly called for peace and solidarity among all faiths on religious holidays.  In September, the secretary general of the Episcopal Conference of the Catholic Church met with representatives of the HCI.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador and embassy officials continued to engage transition government officials, religious leaders, and human rights organizations on the importance of the long-held tradition of interfaith dialogue as a tool to bring peace to the country.  Embassy officials underscored the leaders\u2019 important role in promoting religious tolerance and freedom.  In April, the Ambassador met with influential imams and women religious leaders in Bamako to highlight the role of religious leaders in confronting religious intolerance and promoting peace.  In August, the Ambassador met with Cardinal Jean Zerbo, Catholic Archbishop of Bamako, to discuss the vital role of religious leaders in building peace and national cohesion.  Also in August, for the International Day Commemorating Victims of Violence Based on Religion or Belief, the embassy invited members of an English-language conversation club to discuss the similarities between the United States\u2019 and Mali\u2019s multicultural and multireligious societies.",

The law provides authorities with broad powers to monitor and dissolve religious organizations and groups they determine to be promoting ideas contrary to French values. The constitution includes the concept of secularism, and the law prohibits the wearing of conspicuous religious symbols in public spaces such as schools.\n\nIn April, the government reported that in the previous year, as part of a nationwide program to counter \u201cIslamism and communitarianism,\u201d the Interior Ministry conducted 3,000 assessments and had temporarily closed seven mosques and dissolved five Islamist associations. Following antisemitic statements by a party official in August, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin ordered the dissolution of Civitas, described by multiple sources as a far-right party comprising mostly ultra-traditional Catholics. In March, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses filed an administrative appeal of a government report, stating it made \u201cunsubstantiated and defamatory claims\u201d against the religious group and devoted an excessive amount of attention to the group even though it accounted for only a small number of public complaints. The country\u2019s highest court in June upheld a ban by the national soccer federation on women soccer players wearing the hijab during play, and in September, the government issued a decision prohibiting French athletes from wearing the hijab at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nThe country\u2019s highest administrative court in September upheld a government ban on wearing the abaya in public schools, stating it was in conformity with a law banning the display of conspicuous religious symbols in public schools. The judges ruled the ban did not violate fundamental freedoms, including freedom of religion. According to an August government memorandum, there were 4,710 infringements of the secularism law in schools during the 2022-23 school year, 150 percent higher than the previous school year. In October, Education Minister Gabriel Attal announced that students who had disrupted a moment of silence on October 16 in honor of two individuals killed by Islamists would not be allowed to return to school. Also in October, the government ended financial assistance to the largest Islamic high school in the country following concerns about foreign financing and course material that included a prohibition against apostasy. Following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel and a subsequent fatal terrorist attack in Arras, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne announced the government was elevating the domestic alert status to the highest possible level, enabling the government to enhance security at places of worship. The Prime Minister and two former presidents led a march against antisemitism in Paris in November. Authorities banned pro-Palestinian demonstrations, citing serious risks of disturbances to public order amid heightened tensions linked to the events in the Gaza Strip and a rise in antisemitic acts. In June, President Emmanuel Macron announced a national campaign supporting religious heritage sites, and in a January speech, Interior Minister Darmanin said, \u201cOur secularism is not the erasure of our religions \u2026 it is the possibility for each religion to flourish.\u201d\n\nIn coordination with the Interior Ministry, the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF) reported the total number of antisemitic acts during the year nearly quadrupled to 1,676, up from 436 in 2022. The report indicated that antisemitic acts increased by 1,000 percent since the October 7 Hamas attacks, with 1,242 acts reported after that date, equaling that of the previous three years combined. In one incident, an Avignon court sentenced a woman to five months in prison after she spat on a Jewish man wearing a kippah bearing the Star of David, which, according to news reports, he had been hiding under a cap. According to a September survey of university students, 91 percent of Jewish students experienced antisemitism and 77 percent believed antisemitism was pervasive in higher education, a view shared by only 28 percent among the total student population. In December, the Israeli Aliyah and Integration Ministry and the Jewish Agency for Israel announced there was a 430 percent increase in the number of French applications to emigrate to Israel since October 7. In November, unidentified individuals vandalized a mosque near Bordeaux with graffiti that included messages such as, \u201cYour coffins or your suitcases.\u201d There were incidents of vandalism against Christian churches and a Jewish cemetery.\n\nOfficials from the U.S. embassy, consulates general, and American presence posts (APPs) discussed religious tolerance, antisemitic and anti-Muslim acts, the role of religious freedom in combating violent extremism, and cooperation on these issues with officials at the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs and the Interministerial Delegation to Fight against Racism, Antisemitism, and Anti-LGBT Hate (DILCRAH). The Ambassador and senior U.S. government officials met regularly with religious communities and their leaders throughout the country to discuss religious freedom concerns and encourage interfaith cooperation and tolerance, including engaging Christian, Jewish, and Muslim representatives in Strasbourg, Paris, Marseille, Rennes, Bordeaux, Lyon, and Toulouse and raising Holocaust awareness in Marseille and Strasbourg. In January, the Ambassador hosted an interfaith event for religious and community leaders and government officials to underscore the importance of unity and solidarity to combat rising global religious hatred. The event also launched an embassy initiative to highlight how religious tolerance can be a powerful tool for social inclusion. Following the October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel, the embassy, consulates, and APPs met with local representatives of the Jewish community, student groups, and others to express support and discuss ways to combat rising antisemitism. The embassy regularly used social media to convey messages pertaining to religious freedom.",

The government stated that the new requirements were intended to address gaps in the prevention of money laundering, pointing in particular to arrests of multiple church leaders implicated in cases of international financial or trafficking crimes.  However, civil society groups and the media stated the new requirements were an attempt to suppress and intimidate nonprofit organizations, including churches.  In July, a Namibian Police (NAMPOL) official said during a meeting with traditional healers and charismatic church pastors that some individuals were taking advantage of vulnerable members of society by accusing them of witchcraft, further stating that 27 persons across the country had committed suicide the previous year after being accused of witchcraft.  The government consulted with religious leaders during the year on assisting landless minority groups, protecting workers\u2019 rights in some industries, and combating gender-based violence.

In July, media reported three women attacked a school administrator with sticks and attempted to set fire to her home following accusations that she was practicing witchcraft on students.\n\nU.S. embassy staff engaged with the Office of the Ombudsman and officials from NAMPOL to discuss the content of prior year complaints related to religious freedom and inquire about examples of religious intolerance during the year, although there were no cases reported.  With religious leaders, embassy officials discussed religious tolerance, the government\u2019s engagement with religious groups to help the impoverished, the role of tribal leaders in the expansion of faith-based organizations, and concerns regarding the new financial registration requirements expressed by religious groups.",

The law requires religious groups to register with the government.\n\nThe government continued to require all faith groups, including Christians, to obtain advance permission from municipal or local traditional authorities to hold major public events; some faith groups said the requirements were unreasonable and sometimes resolved only by paying bribes. Representatives of various religious groups, including some Christians, continued to state the government\u2019s policy mandating Christian instruction in schools was harmful because it fostered ignorance of other religions. Faith leaders said the government openly advocated Zionist Christian practices (a local blend of traditional and Christian practices) above all others and did not engage with other religious groups on equal terms during the year. The government issued a statement banning all religious gatherings for Easter other than the one prayer service attended by the King. The government retracted the ban after a public outcry that it infringed upon the constitutional right to worship freely.\n\nNon-Christian groups said they did not experience open persecution and were free to practice their faith in the country. They said, however, this was only true if they did not expect or demand the same rights and privileges as Christian groups. Muslim leaders continued to report negative and suspicious views of Muslims and Islam in society, especially in rural majority-Christian communities.

In response to allegations of government complicity in the 2019 Easter bombings, President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced he would appoint an investigative committee. Civil society groups said that during the year the government used the country\u2019s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act to curtail freedom of expression and to arrest persons for threatening religious harmony and inciting religious hatred. On May 15, President Wickremesinghe ordered an investigation into Protestant Christian pastor Jerome Fernando for making derogatory statements about Buddhism and followers of other religions in a sermon on social media. Some civil society critics and lawyers said the 2022 circular mandating registration for all places of worship and outlining requirements for construction and maintenance of religious places was not constitutional. Civil society representatives said the government used the regulation to unfairly target minority places of worship.\n\nDuring the year the National Christian Evangelical Alliance of Sri Lanka (NCEASL) documented 43 anti-Christian cases of intimidation of and violence against pastors and their congregations, obstruction of worship services, discriminatory actions, and attacks on churches, compared with 80 cases in 2022.

Local authorities, who had long refused to allow the expansion of the mosque, sealed it after work was done without a permit.  In its annual report, the Islamic Community Commission on Religious Freedom stated that the RS government continued to use Orthodox symbols and iconography in public institutions, including schools, and that many schools and local governments continued to celebrate religious holidays and baptisms, showing favoritism toward the SOC.  The official religious representatives of Muslims in the country (Islamic Community) commented on what they saw as anti-Muslim rhetoric by RS President Milorad Dodik.  There was no progress within the Presidency during the year on concluding an agreement drafted in 2015 between the state and the Islamic Community.  Leaders of the four traditional religious communities continued to state that the lack of a national law on restitution, for both religious communities and private citizens, hindered efforts of religious communities to resolve claims of properties confiscated under communist rule from 1946 to 1965.  According to government officials, the government did not implement key provisions of the law on religion as required under the implementing regulations for the religious freedom law in 2019.  The government again did not take steps to follow a 2009 judgment by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) that recommended the country amend its constitution to allow members of minority groups, including Jews and Roma, to run for the Presidency and the House of Peoples, the upper house of the national parliament.\n\nAccording to the Muslim, Catholic, and Serb Orthodox religious communities, authorities continued to discriminate against them in regions where those groups constituted religious minorities, including through the selective enforcement of their rights regarding access to education, language inclusion, employment, health care, and other social services.  Despite a 2015 Constitutional Court ruling that the celebration of January 9 as \u201cRepublika Srpska Day\u201d was unconstitutional, RS officials continued to organize official ceremonies around this day.  On May 9, the Mostar City Council changed the names on signs of six streets in Mostar that had been named after individuals who were members of the World War II-era Ustasha, a Croatian fascist, ultranationalist organization allied with the Nazis during World War II.\n\nThe BiH Interreligious Council (IRC) recorded four incidents of religious intolerance and hatred against religious officials and believers and eight cases of vandalism against religious buildings and cemeteries during the year.  The IRC again stated it believed the actual number of such religiously motivated incidents was much higher but that members of religious groups feared reporting them.  According to media reports, one incident included vandalism in June at a mosque and private homes in the town of Sumanci.  In 2022, according to its most recent report, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported higher numbers, including 23 incidents targeting Muslims, 17 targeting Catholics, 16 targeting Orthodox Christians, and one targeting Jews.  The increased number of incidents compared with 2021, all of which were reported to the police, included vandalism of religious sites, desecration of graveyards, threats against religious believers and officials, including Muslim women for wearing recognizable attire, and disturbances of religious ceremonies.  Some religious services reportedly continued to be used to support activities of radical pokrets (movements), such as the Ravnogorski Pokret, and its annual gathering in Visegrad.  On January 9, fans of the Serbian soccer club Crvena Zvezda [Red Star] celebrated the anniversary of the illegal 1992 declaration of the Republika Srpska\u2019s founding (an unconstitutional declaration not internationally or legally recognized) with a bonfire on Visegrad\u2019s Mehmed Pasa Sokolovic Bridge, a site where many Bosniak Muslims were killed by Serbs.  On January 26, the SOC withdrew from the IRC, blaming recent ethnic tensions that, according to the SOC, the IRC did not adequately condemn.  According to local media, during a local soccer match in Zenica on November 2, a group of approximately 200 Celik soccer club fans held up large banners insulting Mostar\u2019s Croatian Sports Club Zrinjski\u2019s vice-president, Amir Gross Kabiri, an Israeli, with an antisemitic slur, \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve titles and first places, when you are a Jewish whore.\u201d\n\nU.S. embassy officials engaged with national government officials, as well as entity and municipal authorities, to promote respect for religious diversity, press for equal treatment for religious minorities, and encourage a greater role for religious communities in fostering reconciliation and mutual understanding.  Embassy officials reiterated to national government officials the need to adopt restitution legislation and the importance of concluding the agreement with the Islamic Community and implementing agreements with the SOC and Catholic Church.  In July, the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom, and the Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice visited the country.  They attended the 28th annual July 11 commemoration of the 1995 Srebrenica genocide and met with leaders of the four major faith groups in Sarajevo to discuss issues of cooperation, interreligious dialogue, and reconciliation.  On April 26, in response to the refusal of local authorities to allow the expansion of the Rabrani mosque, the Ambassador met with the mayor of Neum, urging him to respect the rights of the Islamic religious community.  Embassy officials held meetings and hosted events with representatives of the Islamic, Orthodox, Catholic, and Jewish communities.

Also later in the month, representatives of the Tartu Jewish Community discovered a memorial to the former Tartu Synagogue was defaced with a swastika and the number \u201c88,\u201d a white supremacist hate symbol standing for \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d  In both cases, police opened an investigation, which was pending at year\u2019s end.\n\nOn September 5, the Ambassador participated in a ceremony held at the Holocaust memorial in Kalevi-Liiva.  The Director of the U.S. State Department Office of International Religious Freedom visited Tallinn on October 2-3 and met with officials from the (MOI), and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  He also met with, the ECC, the head of the Apostolic Estonian Orthodox Church (AEOC), and representatives from Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, the Muslim community, and the Jewish community to discuss religious freedom and the groups\u2019 priorities.  Throughout the year,U.S. embassy officials raised the importance of combating antisemitism, promoting religious tolerance, and promoting Holocaust education in meetings with government officials from the Ministries of Interior, Culture, Education and Research, and Foreign Affairs.  On October 3, the embassy organized a presentation at the Tallinn Jewish School with a speaker from the Wilson Center.  He talked about disinformation and misinformation, the importance of critical thinking, and how his family\u2019s survival of the Holocaust has informed research on the subject.

The Taif Agreement\u2019s stipulations on equality of representation among members of different confessions do not apply to citizens who do not list a religious affiliation on their national registration, and thus they cannot hold seats designated for specific confessions.\n\nAccording to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), Internal Security Forces (ISF) arrested comedian Nour Hajjar on August 29 in connection with a complaint that a leading member of the Dar al-Fatwa, Lebanon\u2019s highest Sunni Muslim religious authority, submitted against him.  The Dar al-Fatwa claimed that a comedy sketch that Hajjar performed on stage in 2018 was \u201can insult to Islam, Muslims, and endangers civil peace in the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to local NGOs, some members of unregistered religious groups, such as Baha\u2019is and members of unrecognized Protestant faiths, continued to list themselves as belonging to recognized religious groups in government records to ensure their marriage and other personal status documents remained legally valid.  Many Baha\u2019is said they chose to list themselves as Shia Muslims in order to effectively manage civil matters that Shia institutions officially administered, while members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Church of Jesus Christ) said they registered as evangelical Protestants.  The government again failed to approve a request from the Jewish community, which includes only 70-100 individuals left living in Lebanon, to change its official name to the Jewish Community Council from the Israelite Communal Council (the group\u2019s officially recognized name).\n\nOn August 23, members of the Christian violent extremist group \u201cSoldiers of God\u201d assaulted members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) community attending a drag event at a Beirut bar.

In areas under Hizballah\u2019s influence, independent NGOs faced harassment and intimidation, including social, political, and financial pressures.  Analysts said Hizballah fears losing its \u201cstate-within-a-state privileges\u201d and its ability to maintain arms \u201cbeyond the control of the state,\u201d which has stoked sectarian tensions and let to limited sectarian conflict.

When Hizballah members tried to prevent local residents from investigating the accident, a gun battle ensued resulting in two deaths, one a Christian villager and the other a Hizballah member.  The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) subsequently took control of the scene.  A Washington think tank stated that the incident was the latest example of friction between Hizballah and members of other religious groups in the country, noting that \u201cthe incident appears to have united the Christian street against Hizballah\u201d and had exacerbated sectarian tensions.\n\nIn May, media outlets reported that a controversy erupted after a group of Christian clergy visited Hizballah\u2019s \u201cLandmark of the Resistance,\u201d a tourist site located near the village of Mleeta in southern Lebanon commemorating Hizballah\u2019s resistance to Israel.

Critics continued to say the government\u2019s failure to adopt a working definition of \u201cIslamophobia\u201d hindered efforts to fight anti-Muslim sentiment and incidents. A government spokesperson defended the adoption by universities of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism after a Palestinian advocacy group and a Middle Eastern studies society issued a report stating the adoption of the definition by most universities, at the urging of the government, \u201cundermined academic freedom and freedom of expression.\u201d The nongovernmental organization (NGO) National Secular Society again publicly called on the government to repeal blasphemy laws in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe UK government announced it would again provide \u00a324.5 million ($31.1 million) to Muslim groups and \u00a33.5 million ($4.4 million) to other non-Jewish faith groups for security measures in their places of worship and schools in England and Wales.

The charity organization Humanists UK again called on the government to legally recognize humanist marriages in England and Wales and increase nonreligious pastoral support in prisons and hospitals. In October, Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf and Scottish Jewish and Muslim leaders pledged to collaborate and oppose all forms of hate crimes, bigotry, and xenophobia.\n\nAccording to Home Office figures, for the 12 months that ended in March (the latest data available), authorities recorded 8,241 religious hate crimes in England and Wales, a decline of 4 percent from the previous period. Of the 7,756 offenses where authorities identified the religious group or groups targeted, 44 percent targeted Muslims and 19 percent targeted Jews. Other targeted groups included Christians, Sikhs, and Hindus. Scottish authorities recorded 576 religiously motivated crimes in the year ending in March, 8 percent more than in the previous period. There was a sharp increase in antisemitic and anti-Muslim incidents throughout the country \u2013 including in schools \u2013 after October 7. The NGO Community Service Trust (CST) reported 4,103 antisemitic incidents during the year \u2013 two-thirds of which occurred after October 7 \u2013 the highest total since the NGO began recording such incidents in 1984. Incidents included assault, threats, desecration of or damage to property, and abusive behavior online. A leading rabbi said the Jewish community was more fearful for its safety than at any time since World War II. The NGO Tell Mama reported 1,432 anti-Muslim incidents between October 7 and December 13, an increase of 634 percent over the same period in 2022. Incidents included physical and verbal abuse and vandalism.\n\nU.S. embassy and consulate general staff in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Bermuda engaged with government officials and political parties as well as a broad spectrum of religious communities and civil society groups, including humanist groups, to broaden understanding of, and advocacy for, freedom of religion and belief. In December, a senior embassy official hosted an interfaith roundtable, which featured youth participants from the UK\u2019s Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Humanist, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh communities. In November, the Second Gentleman of the United States and a senior embassy official hosted a roundtable discussion with Jewish community leaders to discuss the rise in antisemitism.

The government took measures to increase security for government officials in response.  During the year, multiple demonstrations that included partial or full destruction of Qurans took place in the country.  In reaction to these acts, individuals in Iraq stormed and set on fire to Sweden\u2019s embassy, and in Lebanon a Molotov cocktail was thrown at the country\u2019s embassy.  An unknown assailant\u2019s shooting of a consulate staff member in Turkey was also likely linked to the destruction of Qurans.  During the year, the government reiterated it did not condone the actions of the demonstrators and that the constitutional provisions of free speech and free assembly limited government authority to prohibit the demonstrations.  In October, the Linkoping District Court convicted a man of incitement to hatred against an ethnic group (under a criminal law including a religious group) for actions in 2020, in which he burned a Quran along with bacon, left the burned Quran outside a Linkoping mosque, and posted a video on social media.  On August 18, the government commenced an inquiry to review the law and related criteria for processing demonstration permits.\n\nJewish representatives stated mohels (persons who perform male circumcisions) faced increasingly rigorous permitting processes and expressed concern an increased emphasis on children\u2019s rights could lead to a de facto ban on the religious practice.  Jewish leaders criticized a new law requiring independent schools to register denominational elements and said it had forced Jewish schools to classify themselves as religious independent schools.  On March 16, the Schools Inspectorate released a report stating that 24 of 47 inspected independent schools with various religious orientations had not complied with the law by allowing prayers, psalm singing, bible reading, and learning Quran surahs during teaching time.  The inspectorate revoked the permits for four private schools with a Muslim profile, stating students at two of these schools ran an increased risk of radicalization.  In the other cases, the principals allegedly did not comply with financial reporting requirements.  Sweden Democratic Party representatives continued to make provocative and sometimes discriminatory comments about Muslims and Islam.\n\nAfter the Hamas October 7 terrorist attack on Israel, media outlets reported public celebrations by pro-Palestinian demonstrators in Malmo and other cities.  On October 11, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson visited the Jewish community in Malmo to show support for the country\u2019s Jewish community.

Mahibere Kidusan said government security forces seized and deleted contents from the mobile devices of individuals who recorded the killing. In March, Addis Ababa police reportedly disrupted a religious service at St. George Ethiopian Orthodox church, near Menelik II Square, after an Adwa Day celebration led to a confrontation between police and youths. The EHRC said security forces overreacted and used excessive measures.\n\nThere were several reported cases of armed groups and government forces attacking religious centers and churches.

There were reports that members of the OLA burned Protestant churches in the western part of Oromia Region and killed members of the Evangelical Mekane Yesus Church (EECMY). In July, the EOTC made efforts to reconcile the schism with the Tigrayan Orthodox Tewahedo Church (TOTC) but were unsuccessful. Ethiopian Jews said they often faced social exclusion from local communities and were accused of practicing witchcraft to bring harm to non-Jews.\n\nIn April, the U.S. Charg\u00e9 held an interfaith iftar at her residence with then EIASC Vice President Sheikh Abdulaziz Abdulwali and invited representatives from diverse faiths.

In January, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva enacted a law imposing a sentence of two to five years for anyone who obstructs, prevents, or employs violence against any religious practice.  In January, President Lula announced the establishment of the National Day of Traditions of African Roots and Candomble Nations, to be celebrated annually on March 21.

Prior to the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, the government stated that some individuals attempted to use religious cover to defraud individuals.  The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) reported charging several small religious groups with fraud or sanctioning them for other illegal activities.\n\nSome civil society representatives said they were concerned about possible increased economic discrimination by the Christian majority against Muslim immigrants, as poverty and unemployment in the country continued to rise.\n\nPrior to the coup d\u2019etat, U.S. embassy staff met with senior MOI officials, nongovernmental organizations, and local religious leaders to encourage continued respect for religious freedom and expression in the lead-up to the August 26 elections.  After August 30, embassy officials raised concerns with civil society leaders that rising xenophobia could bleed into religious intolerance.",

While the VMW stated it implemented the registration law consistently across all groups, it continued to deny registration to the Catholic Christian Apostolic National Church of Paraguay (ICCAN). During the year, the VMW hosted a National Interreligious Symposium open to all religious groups with a presence in the country on multiple topics regarding family values. In October, President Santiago Pena presented his government\u2019s program to the General Assembly of the Paraguayan Episcopal Conference. He spoke about the social situation of the most vulnerable sectors of society and called upon the religious community to assist those communities. In October, Roman Catholic Church leaders made public statements asking the government for a strong commitment to combat organized crime, drug-trafficking, and poverty and condemning government corruption.\n\nObservers, including those from nongovernmental organizations, political commentators, leaders of different religious groups, and the press, continued to report that the Roman Catholic Church maintained an influential role within society. A representative of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Church of Jesus Christ) reported the church had a close relationship with the Roman Catholic Church, with which it cooperated on humanitarian assistance and other development projects, including providing a new medical oxygen generation plant and x-ray equipment valued at more than two million U.S. dollars to Barrio Obrero Public Hospital.\n\nIn November, U.S. embassy officials met with Vice Minister of Worship David Velazquez and VMW Director General Lizzie Miranda to discuss government actions to facilitate the registration process of religious groups, the promotion of religious freedom, interreligious dialogue, and the provision of state funding for salaries at schools run by religious groups. In September and October, the U.S. Ambassador held separate meetings with Archbishop of Asuncion Adalberto Martinez Flores and Jewish leaders, respectively, to discuss the need for acceptance of all cultures and religions.",

In August, residents of majority-Roman Catholic Rancho Nuevo, Hidalgo State, robbed and destroyed the home of Baptist Pastor Rogelio Hernandez Baltazar.  The vandalism was reportedly in retaliation for Hernandez\u2019s efforts to intervene in a 2022 incident involving Catholic community leaders who severely beat an Indigenous Baptist woman.  Authorities had not arrested any perpetrators of the two violent incidents, even though community members identified the assailants by name.  In January, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued precautionary measures in favor of 11 Jesuit priests facing a \u201cgrave and urgent\u201d situation in Cerocahui, Chihuahua State.  According to SEGOB, DGAR investigated three new religious freedom-related cases, compared with five in 2022.  During the year, the National Council to Prevent Discrimination (CONAPRED) opened two religious discrimination cases, the same number as in 2022.  DGAR registered 196 religious associations during the year, compared with 149 in 2022.

DGAR continued implementing the government\u2019s National Strategy to Promote Respect and Religious Diversity, which included capacity building for religious leaders and public servants.  CONAPRED conducted a course on religious diversity and accompanied religious groups during their religious ceremonies.\n\nDuring the year, there were two reported killings of priests as well as multiple attacks on, threats against, and abductions of, priests and pastors.  Government officials and leaders within the Roman Catholic Church continued to state the attacks reflected high levels of generalized violence throughout the country and were not based on religion.  The NGO Catholic Multimedia Center (CMC) reported 800 incidents of extortion and threats against priests nationwide between October 2022 and October 2023.  The CMC cited Mexico as the one of the most violent countries for priests, reporting killings of more than 40 priests over the previous decade.  According to CONAPRED, incidents of violence against religious leaders did not appear to be based solely on religious identity.  Some NGOs said cartels and other criminal groups continued to single out Catholic priests and other religious leaders because of their condemnation of criminal activities and because communities viewed them as moral authority figures.\n\nU.S. embassy and consulates general representatives at all levels met regularly with government officials responsible for religious and Indigenous affairs at both federal and state levels.  Embassy representatives engaged members of religious groups and faith-based organizations, including the Central Jewish Committee, CMC, and the NGO CSW (formerly known as Christian Solidarity Worldwide), focusing on the safety of religious workers, humanitarian issues, and expressing support for religious tolerance.  The embassy published numerous social media posts advocating religious freedom, including a celebration of interfaith unity, and a commemoration of victims persecuted for their religious beliefs.",

One other was convicted, and another was acquitted. Two women were sentenced to flogging for fornication and two men sentenced to flogging for fornication and alcohol consumption. Victims of online harassment and threats continued to say they believed themselves vulnerable because of past lack of police responsiveness and because past online harassment had sometimes led to violence. Many investigations in criminal cases involving religious freedom issues continued without much visible progress. The Communications Authority of Maldives continued to maintain an unpublished blacklist of websites containing material it deemed un-Islamic or anti-Islamic. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs (MIA) continued to maintain control over all matters related to religion and religious belief, including requiring imams to use government-approved sermons in Friday services. The government maintained its ownership and control of all mosques, including their maintenance and funding. According to the MIA, foreign residents such as teachers, laborers, and tourists, including on resort islands, remained free to worship in their own residences, but congregating in public for non-Islamic prayer remained illegal, as was encouraging local citizens to participate in such activities. The MIA continued to conduct what it termed \u201cawareness programs\u201d through radio and television broadcasts in the capital Male\u2019 and on various islands to give citizens information on Islam, and it continued to provide assistance and counseling to foreigners seeking to convert to Islam.

Threats included calls to implement sharia penalties for those who criticized Islam and references to persons perceived as criticizing Islam as being \u201cwestern agents.\u201d NGOs continued to report instances of individuals deemed \u201csecularists\u201d or \u201capostates\u201d receiving death threats and being cyberbullied. NGOs also reported continued community pressure on women to wear hijabs and verbal harassment of women who chose not to do so.

In November, a court sentenced five members of the Tizi Ghenif church to three years in prison and a fine for unauthorized worship and producing religious materials for distribution. In October, the same court sentenced Pastor Allahoum of the Ouacif church to two months in prison and a fine for opening a place of worship without authorization. Both cases were pending appeal. On February 1, the Supreme Court overturned on appeal the conviction of Said Djabelkhir, an Islamic scholar specializing in Sufism and a founder of the \u201cCircle of Enlightenment for Free Thought,\u201d of blasphemy. In 2021, Djabelkhir was convicted of blasphemy for \u201coffending the precepts of Islam\u201d and was sentenced to three years in prison, in addition to a fine.\n\nLeaders of the Protestant Church of Algeria (EPA) stated that six EPA-affiliated churches closed following either direct orders from the government or a decision by church leaders due to significant pressure from authorities. Only three EPA-affiliated churches remained open at the end of the year.\n\nSome Christian leaders and congregants stated that non-Muslims faced social pressure for practicing a non-Muslim faith.

Media reports indicated that ISIS-M targeted both Muslim and Christian communities. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), news media outlets, and human rights organizations stated that socioeconomic grievances among the northern region\u2019s historically marginalized majority-Muslim population were contributing factors to the insurgency, along with religious motivations, and cautioned that casting the violence as primarily religious risked exacerbating those grievances. Muslim and Christian leaders condemned violence as a means of political change, and Muslim leaders emphasized that religious-based violence that invoked Islam was inconsistent with tenets of the faith. Muslim and Christian groups coordinated assistance to persons internally displaced by the violence in the north.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador engaged senior officials on the violence in the northern region, noting the continued need to engage the religious community to effectively address the violence. The Ambassador and embassy officers discussed the importance of religious tolerance in promoting peace and security with representatives of religious groups and local civil society organizations, including peace clubs, and held iftars in northern Mozambique.

The government reported it implemented the change to fulfill EU obligations; there were no reports of arrests or prosecutions under the new law.  In cooperation with the National Coordinator for Combatting Antisemitism, the city of Amsterdam set up a support point for schools to respond to inquiries concerning Holocaust education and antisemitism.

The council said the event was an effort to deescalate tensions resulting from the violent protests that followed the impeachment of former president Pedro Castillo and Boluarte\u2019s installation as president in December 2022. There were 168 non-Catholic religious groups registered with the government \u2013 including the newly registered Union of Evangelical Christian Churches of Peru \u2013 compared with 174 in 2022. Evangelical missionaries cited longer waiting periods and a lack of transparency in approval procedures for visas during the year and said the government did not afford them the same privileges as the Catholic Church. The Interreligious Council continued to engage the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights (MOJ) to promote religious freedom principles, such as equal access to government benefits for all religious groups and the opportunity to serve as military chaplains. The council said the government took no action on most of the recommendations it made to former president Castillo before he was impeached.\n\nA group characterized as far right and extremist threatened and harassed a Jewish journalist investigating police violence.

Religious converts from Islam sometimes faced severe stigmatization.  Muslim women who did not wear headscarves or conform to religious notions of modesty were often subject to shaming in public and on social media.  A November survey by Pew Research Center found that while 62 percent of adults said religious, ethnic, and cultural diversity made the country a better place to live, about half of Muslim respondents believed the growing number of Christians and Buddhists were a threat to Islam in the country.\n\nU.S. embassy officials discussed with government officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Women, Family, and Community Development, Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Prime Minister\u2019s Department, and the Parliament Special Select Committee (PSSC) on Human Rights, Elections, and Institutional Reform, and the PSSC on International Relations and Trade, among others, issues including constitutional provisions on freedom of religion, the increase in religious intolerance, and respect for religious minorities.  Embassy officials visited houses of worship of various faiths to underscore the importance of respecting religious pluralism.  Embassy representatives met with members of religious groups, including minority groups and those whose activities were limited by the government, to discuss the restrictions they faced and strategies for engagement with the government on issues of religious freedom.  The embassy facilitated and ensured the participation of religious leaders from various faiths and scholars in various exchanges and conferences that promoted religious freedom and tolerance.",

There were no public reports of schools impinging on students\u2019 rights to observe Ramadan in 2023.  Opposition to President Nana Akufo-Addo\u2019s proposal to build an interdenominational national Christian cathedral continued, with critics questioning whether the cathedral, with costs estimated at $400 million, should be a priority for a country with urgent development needs.\n\nMuslim and Christian leaders said they regularly communicated among themselves on religious matters and on ways to address issues of mutual concern or sensitivity.  There were continued Muslim-Christian and intra-Muslim tensions in the country, with the latter being found largely in northern areas.  Researchers described the main cause of intra-Muslim tensions as doctrinal differences.  They also noted that disputes between farmers and herders and an influx of asylum-seekers and other migrants from Burkina Faso heightened tensions.  The West Africa Center for Counter Extremism organized community workshops and forums aimed at improving inter- and intra-religious (Muslim) relations in the Upper East, Upper West, and Northern Regions.\n\nU.S. embassy representatives discussed the importance of mutual understanding, religious tolerance, and respect for all religious groups with government officials and religious leaders, including engagement with the interfaith National Peace Council and regional peace councils.  The embassy commemorated Muslim and Christian holidays through social media posts, including in local languages.  Embassy officials also engaged Muslim organizations and educators on the need to advance religious freedom and prevent violent extremism related to religion.  In June, embassy representatives visited the National Chief Imam to make an Eid al-Adha food donation.  The Ambassador and other embassy officials also routinely met with Christian religious leaders, including from the charismatic Christian, Protestant, and Catholic communities.",

        "summary": "The constitution defines the country as an Islamic republic and specifies Twelver Ja\u2019afari Shia Islam as the official state religion.  It states all laws and regulations must be based on \u201cIslamic criteria\u201d and an official interpretation of sharia.  The constitution states citizens shall enjoy human, political, economic, and other rights, \u201cin conformity with Islamic criteria.\u201d  The penal code provides for hudud punishments (those mandated by sharia), including amputation, flogging, and stoning.  It specifies the death penalty for moharebeh (\u201cenmity against God\u201d) and sabb al-nabi (\u201cinsulting the Prophet\u201d).  Prevailing fatwas prescribe the death penalty for apostasy.  According to the penal code, the application of the death penalty varies depending on the religion of both the perpetrator and the victim.  The penal code criminalizes insulting \u201cdivine religions or Islamic schools of thought\u201d and committing \u201cany deviant educational or proselytizing activity that contradicts or interferes with the sacred law of Islam.\u201d  Proselytization of religions other than Islam carries a punishment of up to 10 years in prison.  Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) said these provisions put religious minorities at a higher risk of persecution.  The law, as typically interpreted, prohibits Muslim citizens from changing or renouncing their religious beliefs.  The constitution states that Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians are the only recognized religious minorities permitted to worship and form religious societies \u201cwithin the limits of the law.\u201d\n\nAccording to UN experts, numerous international human rights NGOs, and media reporting, the government convicted and executed peaceful protesters on charges of \u201cenmity against God\u201d and dissidents on charges of blasphemy and spreading anti-Islamic propaganda.  A June report by the UN Secretary-General stated that ethnic and religious minorities were \u201csignificantly affected\u201d in the context of the nationwide protests following the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa (Zhina) Amini, a Sunni Kurdish citizen whom the \u201cmorality police\u201d (Gasht-e Ershad, literally \u201cguidance patrol\u201d) detained for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly and thereby violating the country\u2019s strict Islamic dress code.  The report also stated the government disproportionately imposed death sentences on persons belonging to ethnic minorities, including members of the Baloch, Arab, and Kurdish minorities.  According to the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), the government executed at least 746 individuals during the year, including for offenses classified as \u201ccorruption on earth\u201d or \u201cideological-political-religious reasons,\u201d and arrested 142 citizens for religious reasons.  HRANA said the majority of human rights violations against religious minorities involved Baha\u2019is (85 percent), but also impacted Sunnis (11 percent), Yarsans (2 percent), Gonabadi Dervishes, Christians, and other religious minorities.\n\nAccording to the NGO United for Iran\u2019s Iran Prison Atlas, at year\u2019s end, authorities held 115 persons in prison for \u201creligious practice,\u201d including Baluch, Baha\u2019i, Sunni, Christian, and some Shia men and women.  Charges included membership in or leadership of organizations that \u201cdisrupt national security\u201d and \u201cspread propaganda against the regime.\u201d  The NGO Humanists International stated individuals expressing nonreligious views suffered severe persecution, including violence.  The government denied individuals access to attorneys and obtained false confessions through torture in some cases.  It reportedly detained and held members of religious minorities incommunicado.  The NGO Human Rights Without Frontiers (HRWF) reported more than 1,000 Baha\u2019is were either imprisoned, in custody, under house arrest, or waiting for a hearing or to be summoned by a court.  According to human rights NGOs, authorities increasingly targeted Sunni religious leaders for persecution, arrest, and imprisonment in retaliation for criticizing the government; some reported being tortured while in custody.  Christian converts from Islam reported being detained and forced to sign commitments to refrain from further Christian activities or ordered to attend Islamic re-education sessions.  Human rights NGOs reported judges continued to sentence religious minorities to internal exile.\n\nAccording to the Baha\u2019i International Community (BIC) and multiple international news organizations, security forces in cities across the country continued to shut down Baha\u2019i-owned businesses, conducted multiple raids of Baha\u2019i homes, arrested Baha\u2019is in their homes or workplaces on unsubstantiated charges, and confiscated money and personal belongings.  BIC reported authorities closed 59 businesses from mid-July to mid-August.  In a February report, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran Javaid Rehman stated the Baha\u2019i minority \u201cremained most severely persecuted, with a marked increase in arrests, targeting, and victimization,\u201d including being deprived of livelihoods, denied access to higher education, and denied the ability to bury their dead in accordance with Baha\u2019i rites.  BIC reported that between March and May, authorities sentenced four Baha\u2019is to five years in prison for seeking to facilitate Baha\u2019i burials.\n\nOn September 20, parliament approved a bill that, if adopted, would increase penalties for noncompliance with the Islamic dress code as interpreted by authorities, raising prison time for violating the code from two months to 10 years and increasing the fine from 500,000 rials ($12) to up to 360 million rials ($8,600).  In April, the government announced a domestic surveillance program, including using street cameras, to enforce the hijab law; authorities closed 45 businesses for allowing patrons to violate the law.\n\nThe government continued to regulate Christian religious practices.  Christian worship in Farsi was forbidden and official reports and state-run media continued to characterize private Christian churches in homes as \u201cillegal networks\u201d and \u201cZionist propaganda institutions.\u201d  Authorities reportedly continued to deny members of unrecognized religious minority groups access to education and government employment unless they declared themselves as belonging to one of the country\u2019s recognized religions on their application forms.\n\nGovernments officials in Greece, the United Kingdom, and Germany warned of or took legal action against individuals who plotted or carried out attacks on Jewish sites in those countries, allegedly at the behest of Iranian authorities.  In September, the director of Israel\u2019s intelligence agency said the agency and its allies had foiled 27 attacks against Jews and Israelis overseas during the year and that all of them were directed by Iran.  Following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei denied Iranian involvement but praised Hamas\u2019 actions against \u201cthe Zionist regime.\u201d  Some analysts said, however, that Hamas would not have been able to carry out such an attack without Iran\u2019s long-time assistance, funding, and training.  Iranian nationals from religious minority groups reported they sometimes received threats to themselves or their families from apparent regime officials while abroad.\n\nThroughout the year, authorities reportedly continued to propagate hate speech and falsehoods against religious minorities in speeches and through traditional and social media platforms.  On December 19, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution expressing \u201cserious concern\u201d about increasing restrictions on and violence against religious minorities and condemning the regime for propagating antisemitism.\n\nMedia outlets reported that on August 13, gunmen opened fire on the Shia Shah Cheragh Shrine in Shiraz, killing two persons and injuring eight.  Authorities arrested eight foreign nationals, including a Tajik national who said he had cooperated with ISIS.  A panel of UN experts said between November 2022 and March 2023, there were targeted poisoning attacks against 91 schools in 20 provinces across the country, affecting 1,200 schoolgirls; the experts speculated the poisonings were retaliation for the girls expressing opposition to the mandatory hijab.\n\nBaha\u2019is continued to be targets of violence and social stigma as government repression continued to intensify; perpetrators reportedly continued to act with impunity.  There continued to be reports of non-Baha\u2019is dismissing or refusing employment to Baha\u2019is.  According to human rights NGOs, converts from Islam to Christianity faced continuing societal pressure and rejection by community members.  Shia clerics denounced Sufism in sermons and public statements, and Sunni students reported professors continued to routinely insult Sunni religious figures in class.  In Kurdish regions, NGOs reported Shia clerics asked children to spy on Jewish students and that students who befriend Jewish or Christian classmates were surveilled by authorities.\n\nThe United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran.  During the year, the U.S. government used public statements, sanctions, and diplomatic initiatives in international fora to condemn and promote accountability for the government\u2019s abuses against and restrictions on worship by members of religious minorities.  The President and other senior U.S. government officials expressed support for peaceful protesters and used social media to affirm the rights of the country\u2019s religious minorities and to call for the release of prisoners of conscience.\n\nSince 1999, Iran has been designated as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom.  On December 29, 2023, the Secretary of State redesignated Iran as a CPC.  The following sanction was identified in connection with the designation:  visa restrictions pursuant to section 221(c) of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (TRA) for certain senior officials of the Government of Iran identified under section 221(a)(1)(C) of the TRA in connection with the commission of serious human rights abuses against citizens of Iran or their family members.",

The constitution adopted by popular referendum and confirmed on December 28 by the Supreme Court provides for freedom of religion and equality before the law without distinction as to religion.  The constitution prohibits \u201cAny propaganda of an ethnic, tribal, regional or religious nature tending to undermine national unity or the secularism of the State.\u201d  The Director of Religious and Traditional Affairs under the Ministry of Interior oversees religious matters, arbitrates intercommunal disputes, and ensures religious freedoms outlined in the constitution are protected.  With the exception of traditional Indigenous groups, the government requires all other religious groups and foreign missionary organizations to register with the Ministry of Interior.\n\nThe government maintained a ban on a Wahhabi association from participating on the High Council of Islamic Affairs (HCIA), but media outlets said enforcement of the ban remained difficult and Wahhabis continued to meet and worship in their own mosques.  There were public debates over the Islamic practice of diya (financial compensation paid to victims of violence), sometimes proposed by local authorities to resolve conflicts between Muslim and Christian individuals or communities.\n\nMuch of the country remained relatively free from significant conflict between religious groups and violence from extremist movements, with some violent conflict concentrated in the Lake Chad basin area.  Analysts and human rights groups reported that poverty and a lack of government services and economic opportunity raised the risks that violent extremism, including violent extremism related to religion, could spread inside the country.  Catholic media reported some tensions between Christians and younger imams in the south-central part of the country, although they stated religious freedom was not overtly constrained.  \n\nIn March, Transitional President Mahamat Deby met with Archbishop of N\u2019Djamena Edmond Djitangar before the President participated in the inauguration of N\u2019Djamena\u2019s Catholic Cathedral on April 29.  The government observed both Christian and Muslim religious holidays as national holidays including, Eid al-Adha, the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, Eid al-Fitr, Easter Monday, All Saints\u2019 Day, and Christmas Day.\n\nIn May, armed groups in the Logone Oriental region attacked a number of Christian communities and killed 17 individuals, including a pastor and 12 congregants attending a prayer meeting; 20 villages were burned and thousands or persons displaced in the attacks.  Media outlets reported the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Boko Haram continued to threaten communities throughout the Lake Chad Basin region, including through abductions, taxation, and raids.  Religious leaders pointed to resource-based conflicts involving mostly Muslim herders and mostly Christian farmers as contributing to tensions between Christians and Muslims.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador met multiple times with the president of the HCIA to discuss interfaith dialogue, peace, and the role of Islam in society.  He also met with the Archbishop of N\u2019Djamena and Djimalngar Madjibaye of the Association of Evangelical Churches and Missions (EEMET) and encouraged them to use their moral leadership as a channel for national reconciliation and peaceful coexistence.",

The government recognizes four officially registered religious groups: the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Sunni Islam, the Catholic Church, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eritrea.\n\nDuring the year, the government again arrested individuals based on religion. The Christian nongovernmental organization (NGO) Release International reported the arrest of 177 members of unregistered Christian groups between January and April as they gathered in private homes to worship or record worship music. The NGO said the detainees were held in Mai Serwa Prison. Pastor Tesfay Seyoum, founder and leader of Meserete Kristos Church, died of a brain hemorrhage during the year while he was detained in Mai Serwa. In July, the Christian NGO Voice of the Martyrs Canada reported that two pastors remained in detention without charges since 2004. There was no information on the conditions under which these detainees were being held, or on the charges against them, if any. NGOs said that in the past, authorities kept some Christian detainees in shipping containers and beat and tortured them to try to force them to renounce their faith.\n\nThe government released 22 Christian detainees between March and July, including some who had been in prison for more than nine years, according to international NGOs. The government provided no information about the charges against the detainees or why they were released. The government also released 300 Muslims from prison in July. These were mostly students who were arrested after protesting government efforts to regulate their school in 2017. Release International estimated that even factoring the number of prisoners freed during the year, there were more than 500 Christians in detention at year\u2019s end. Other NGOs said as many as 1,000 were detained, including 32 Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, for refusing to participate in military service or renounce their faith.\n\nUnregistered religious groups lacked the privileges of registered groups and their members risked arrest and mistreatment, with renunciation of their faith as a condition of their release. The government allowed some unregistered groups to operate and tolerated their worship activities. International NGOs and international media continued to report that members of all religious groups were, to varying degrees, subjected to government abuses and restrictions. The government continued to deny citizenship to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses after stripping them of citizenship in 1994 for refusing to participate in the referendum that created the independent state of Eritrea.\n\nThe government\u2019s lack of transparency and intimidation of civil society and religious communities continued to make it difficult to obtain information on the status of societal respect for religious freedom. International observers, however, continued to state that religious tolerance appeared to be widespread between different groups within society. Churches and mosques were near each other, and most citizens congratulated members of other religious groups on religious holidays and other events. There were no reports of sectarian violence, and most towns and ethnic groups included members from all the major religious groups.\n\nU.S. officials in Asmara and Washington raised religious freedom concerns with government officials throughout the year, including the detention of members of unregistered religious groups and the lack of alternative service for conscientious objectors. U.S. embassy officials further discussed religious freedom on a regular basis with a wide range of individuals, including members of most religious groups, including unregistered ones; members of the diplomatic corps based in Asmara; and UN officials. Embassy officials used social media and outreach programs to engage the public and highlight the commitment of the United States to religious freedom.\n\nSince 2004, Eritrea has been designated a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom. On December 29, 2023, the Secretary of State redesignated Eritrea as a CPC and identified the following sanction that accompanied the designation: the existing ongoing restrictions referenced in 22 CFR 126.1 pursuant to section 402(c)(5) of the Act.",

The law prohibits blasphemy and apostasy and defines them as crimes punishable by death; however, the government has never applied the death penalty for these crimes.\n\nOn July 18, police in the town of Atar arrested a 19-year-old female student accused of writing blasphemous text directed at the Prophet Muhammad in answers on her end-of-year baccalaureate exam in violation of a 2018 amendment to the blasphemy provision of the country\u2019s penal code. A teacher posted the exam answers on social media and was subsequently arrested and charged with publishing insults against the Prophet Muhammad on a social network. In August, the teacher was sentenced to six months in prison and another six months of judicial supervision. On November 27, judicial authorities released the teacher from prison. At year\u2019s end, the student remained in custody pending prosecution. Religious groups advocating a strict interpretation of Islam placed intense public pressure on the government to severely punish the student, including imposing the death penalty.\n\nDuring the year, some militant Islamist groups made increased public calls for broader application of the country\u2019s sharia-based criminal code. Civil society groups continued to report social inhibitions to challenging religious norms or discussing religious freedom and slavery. A Christian nongovernmental organization (NGO) reported that converts from Islam faced extreme societal and family pressure.\n\nU.S. embassy officials raised apostasy, blasphemy, and other religious freedom issues with authorities on multiple occasions. Embassy representatives, including the Ambassador, discussed religious tolerance with senior government officials, including the Minister of Justice. During Ramadan, the Ambassador hosted an iftar and raised religious tolerance with the religious leaders in attendance. Visiting U.S. officials also raised the importance of religious tolerance with the government and a range of societal groups. In January, the U.S. Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom visited Nouakchott to attend the African Conference for Peace for the second year in a row and met with government officials and civil society organizations. Embassy staff also met with senior members of the Islamist opposition Tawassoul Party to discuss political and social issues, including religious freedom.

Membership in the Muslim Brotherhood or \u201cSalafist\u201d organizations remains illegal and punishable with imprisonment or death.\n\nSectarian violence continued during the year due to tensions among religious groups that, according to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and media sources, were exacerbated by regime actions, continued economic deterioration, and the broader ongoing conflict in the country. At year\u2019s end, more than half of the country\u2019s prewar population remained displaced, including 6.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 5.1 million refugees. Regime and proregime forces continued aerial and ground offensives in the country\u2019s northwest, killing civilians and displacing over 10,000 additional persons. The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) documented at least 33 attacks on mosques in the country during the year, attributing 31 attacks to the regime (94 percent) and two (6 percent) attacks to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nThere were widespread reports that the regime, supported by its Russian and Iranian allies, continued to commit human rights abuses against its perceived opponents, the majority of whom, reflecting the country\u2019s demographics, were Sunni Muslims that the regime described as violent extremists. There also continued to be reports that the regime and its foreign supporters engaged in the extensive destruction of hospitals, homes, and other civilian infrastructure. The SNHR reported at least 2,317 cases of arbitrary detentions or forcible disappearance during the year, including 129 children and 87 women. As of December, the SNHR reported at least 156,457 persons who remained arbitrarily detained or forcibly disappeared by the regime or other conflict parties between 2011 and December. The Assad regime is responsible for 87 percent (136,047 including 3,696 children and 8,495 women) of these cases. Members of the Alawite minority group continued to hold an elevated political status disproportionate to its numbers, particularly in leadership positions in the military, security, and intelligence services.\n\nOn January 14, the regime issued Legislative Decree No. 2 to regulate the affairs and welfare of the 1.2 million orphans in the country. According to Syrians for Truth and Justice (STJ), the decree stated that a child of unknown parentage is a \u201cMuslim unless proven otherwise\u201d and that a foster family can apply to foster a child only \u201cif the couple and the child share the same religion.\u201d In August, the Druze community in Suwayda and Dara\u2019a started a wave of antigovernment protests over rising fuel prices and economic conditions that continued through the end of the year. On September 13, regime forces fired on demonstrators in Suwayda who were attempting to close the Baath Party headquarters, injuring three individuals. A senior Druze cleric in Suwayda said, \u201ceveryone who supports this defunct [Baath] party is \u2026 outside of the religious values and principles on which we were raised.\u201d In a December 18 speech posted to YouTube, President Assad said that there was no evidence that six million Jews died in the Holocaust and that the Nazis did not employ a special method of torture or killing for the Jews. He said that the Jews who were killed had died like other victims of World War II. According to the Middle East Institute, the Alawite community, among other religious communities, have expressed growing frustration over the economy and the centralization of power in the Assad family. In response, Waseem al-Assad, identified as a militia leader, drug lord, and distant cousin of the president, criticized the regime\u2019s traditional Alawite supporters on social media, reminding them of their privileged position in society.\n\nThe UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic (COI), human rights groups, and media organizations reported abuses by some armed Syrian opposition groups, which operated with the support of Turkey, reportedly focused on Kurdish and Yezidi residents in and around Afrin as well as other civilians. Those reported abuses included: killings; abduction and disappearance of civilians; physical abuse, including rape and sexual violence; forced displacement from homes; transfer of detained civilians across the border into Turkey; recruitment or use of child soldiers; looting; appropriating private property; and desecration of religious sites. Reports also indicated that the small number of Christians remaining in Aleppo were very concerned about possible attacks by Syrian opposition groups supported by Turkey. STJ documented large-scale confiscations of Yezidi-owned property by various armed groups. According to STJ\u2019s report, \u201cthe perpetrators expropriated several houses, shops, and olive groves owned by members of the Yezidi religion.\u201c In August, the COI noted Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham\u2019s (HTS) control over the daily life of residents in areas under its influence in northwest Syria and reported that HTS continued to unlawfully detain activists, journalists and private citizens who were critical, including on social media, of their rule or religious doctrine. According to an October NGO report, HTS forced farmers in Idlib to pay levies and \u201ctaxes\u201d on wheat harvests under the pretext of collecting \u201czakat\u201d (almsgiving required as one of the five pillars of Islam). ISIS engaged in terrorist attacks during the year, including attacks near Palmyra in February, March, and April on individuals collecting truffles, resulting in numerous deaths. Human rights organizations stated that ISIS often targeted civilians, persons suspected of collaborating with security forces, and groups that it deemed to be apostates. Many former victims of ISIS remained missing.\n\nThroughout the year, there were continued reports of sectarian violence due to tensions among religious groups, cultural rivalries, and provocative rhetoric. Christians reportedly continued to face discrimination and violence at the hands of violent extremist groups. In July, two bombs exploded in separate attacks near the Shia shrine of Sayyida Zeinab, a site of mass pilgrimage for Shias from across the world, including Shia militia fighters, in a Damascus suburb in the days before the holy day of Ashura. Two persons were injured in the first explosion on July 25, while the second blast, on July 27, killed at least six individuals and injured dozens.\n\nNGOs reported social conventions and religious proscriptions continued to make conversions relatively rare, especially Muslim-to-Christian conversions, which are prohibited by law. These groups also reported that societal pressure continued to force converts from Islam to Christianity to relocate within the country or to emigrate in order to practice their new religion openly.\n\nThe President of the United States and senior Department of State officials continued to state that a political solution to the conflict should be based on UN Security Council Resolution 2254 and respect for the human rights of the country\u2019s citizens. Department of State officials continued to work with the UN special envoy for Syria, members of the opposition, and the international community to support UN-facilitated, Syrian-led efforts in pursuit of a political solution to the conflict that would safeguard the human rights, including freedom of religion or belief, of all citizens. In September, a senior State Department official met with a senior Druze leader to discuss the ongoing protests in southern Syria. The Department of State continued to support the evidence-gathering work of UN bodies and NGOs to promote accountability for the atrocities that the regime and ISIS have committed, as well as abuses committed by other parties to the conflict.",

The Senate formed a committee to investigate the deaths and the proliferation of religious organizations and released a report in October.  The Registrar of Societies deregistered several churches, including MacKenzie\u2019s, and one led by an alleged MacKenzie associate who obtained a court order suspending the decision.  Human rights groups and Muslim organizations cited fewer concerns about the government\u2019s antiterrorism tactics, but they continued to report Muslim community complaints of intimidation, arbitrary arrest, and extortion by police.  In May, the Court of Appeal ruled in favor of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses students who asked to not be forced to attend Catholic Mass and nonclassroom interfaith activities in school.\n\nIn April, authorities discovered that members of MacKenzie\u2019s Good News International Ministries Church in the Shakahola Forest in Kilifi County had apparently starved themselves to death, allegedly on his instructions, to attain salvation.  Authorities arrested Mackenzie and had not yet charged him in connection with the Shakahola deaths at year\u2019s end, but he remained in prison on unrelated charges.  At year\u2019s end, the government had exhumed 429 bodies, many of them children.  The deaths spurred a robust public debate about how and whether to further regulate churches to prevent extremist beliefs.  In August, the terrorist organization al-Shabaab killed two persons and burned down at least 10 homes and a church in a predominantly Christian village in Lamu West.  In March, unknown perpetrators in Nairobi set fire to a church and damaged a mosque during protests against cost-of-living increases.  Religious leaders called for calm.  The Atheists in Kenya society again said its members experienced intolerance and indirect discrimination.\n\nU.S. embassy representatives and U.S. officials in Washington met with government officials and stressed the role of interfaith dialogue in stemming religious intolerance, countering violent extremism, and addressing the grievances of marginalized religious and ethnic groups.  The Ambassador and other embassy officials met with a wide variety of religious leaders and groups and discussed the importance of religious interfaith collaboration and the role of religious leaders in promoting freedom of religion and other human rights, among other topics.  The embassy launched a series of strategic dialogues among religious leaders of various faiths to promote interreligious tolerance and respect for the human rights of underrepresented and minority groups.",

The Jewish Community of Moldova (JCM) continued to state the government did not properly maintain most Jewish cemeteries across the country or protect them from vandalism. According to the religious communities concerned, authorities again did not address their longstanding efforts to regain properties confiscated during the Holocaust and Soviet era, or to obtain similar properties. Prison authorities denied Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses requests to visit inmates who are not Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n\nIn the Transnistria Region, a Russia-backed separatist area internationally recognized as part of Moldova, but where the Moldovan government does not exercise de facto control, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses reported their situation continued to worsen.

Transnistrian \u201claw\u201d criminalized complaints by residents of the region to foreign judicial bodies such as the European Court for Human Rights. The Muslim community did not pursue plans to secure a location for a mosque in Transnistria and a Muslim educational and cultural center in Tiraspol, citing financial constraints and a desire not to create tension with local \u201cauthorities.\u201d Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses reported improvements with respect to conscientious objection to \u201cmilitary\u201d service in Transnistria. They said Transnistrian \u201cauthorities\u201d amended the \u201claw\u201d on alternate civilian service to allow the group\u2019s members to undertake alternative civilian service within any \u201cstate\u201d institution.\n\nThe JCM reported instances of antisemitic hate speech and instigation to discrimination and violence against the Jewish community, especially on the internet. On September 12, the U.S. embassy announced a grant of $200,000 to be awarded to the National Jewish History Museum of Moldova for the restoration of the Beit Kaddishim (funeral hall) within the Chisinau Jewish Cemetery. The three-year project is a partnership between the U.S. and Moldovan government and will include conducting an archaeological site survey, historical research, and ultimate restoration of the Beit Kaddishim.\n\nThe Muslim community noted societal acceptance of Muslims had improved since 2011, but some challenges remained.

Unregistered religious groups operate freely and are eligible for some of the benefits that registered groups receive, but they must apply separately for them.\n\nBetween January and July, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) expelled 35 individuals, mainly due to links with what the ministry characterized as \u201cviolent extremist Islamist groups.\u201d  Muslim groups \u2013 of which none has an accord with the government \u2013 continued to face challenges obtaining permission from local governments to construct mosques and provide dedicated areas appropriate for Islamic burials.  Some local governments authorized construction of mosques or temporary prayer centers and to acquire or expand plots for Islamic burials, but according to the Union of Islamic Cultural Communities (UCOII), these actions were not enough to meet growing demand.

In the wake of the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel, there were numerous high-profile incidents of antisemitism, including a man threatening Genoa Rabbi Fabrizio Haim Cipriani with a screwdriver while shouting antisemitic threats.  National and local media reported on numerous examples of antisemitic graffiti and posters, including depictions of swastikas on walls, antisemitic stereotypes, and praise of neo-Nazi groups in cities such as Rome, Milan, and Chieti.  The Antisemitism Observatory, run by the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Jewish Contemporary Documentation Center Foundation (CDEC), recorded 454 antisemitic acts during the year, compared with 241 in 2022 and 220 in 2021.

They also continued to discuss efforts to integrate new migrants \u2013 many of whom were Muslim, Orthodox Christian, or Hindu \u2013 and second-generation migrants living in the country.  Embassy officials expressed support for a proposed agreement between the government and the country\u2019s Muslim communities.  Senior U.S. government officials visiting from Washington met with religious leaders and civil-society representatives to promote interfaith dialogue and awareness, and to encourage religious groups to be more effective in interfaith outreach.  On March 27 and October 9, the U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism met with then national coordinator for the fight against antisemitism Giuseppe Pecoraro, Jewish community representatives, and governmental officials to discuss how to support their efforts to counter antisemitism, promote interfaith dialogue, and at the second meeting, discuss the response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 terrorist attacks.

Based on the court\u2019s ruling, the Ministry of Education (MOE) released a letter to all schools across the country stating that Rastafarian children must be allowed to attain an education.\n\nMuslim organizations continued to request that the MOE discontinue use of the mandatory Christian-oriented \u201cBible knowledge\u201d course and use only the broader based \u201cmoral and religious education\u201d curriculum in primary schools, particularly in areas inhabited predominantly by Muslims; however, the Bible knowledge course continued to be taught in most publicly funded primary schools and in the first two years in secondary schools.  By year\u2019s end, the MOE had still not acted on a proposal, contained in its 2021 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Christian and Muslim leaders, for a blanket policy allowing the wearing of hijabs in all schools.  The MOU allowed female students to wear hijabs in their school colors as a part of their uniform, but implementation of the hijab policy was uneven, with some schools allowing the practice and others requiring permission from school management.  The MOE also did not act on a separate proposal in the MOU to include members of religious minorities on the board of the Malawi Institute of Education.\n\nThe Public Affairs Committee (PAC), an umbrella organization comprising the major faith communities in the country, helped disseminate information on the MOU concerning wearing of hijabs in school and also helped mediate between the Catholic and Muslim communities concerning remarks by a Catholic bishop which some Muslims said they found offensive.

There were reports of detention of Rohingya Muslims, including youth, fleeing religious and ethnic persecution in Burma. In March, immigration authorities in Pattaya detained 63 Chinese Christians from Shenzhen, and in April, facilitated their departure for agreed legal resettlement in a third country. On May 9, police raided Wat Pa Thammakhiri, a Buddhist temple in Nakhon Ratchasima, uncovered gold and jewelry and ultimately arrested seven monks and two drivers on charges of embezzling approximately 300 million baht ($8.7 million) from donations received since 2020. Some Buddhist groups continued to express frustration with perceived special allowances for Muslims. The government responded by opening an existing assistance program to students from all faiths.\n\nThere were continued attacks against both Buddhists and Muslims in the Deep South, where religious and ethnic identity are closely linked in a longstanding separatist conflict. According to Deep South Watch, violence in the Deep South resulted in at least 109 deaths \u2013 82 Muslims, 23 Buddhists, and four individuals with unidentified religious affiliation \u2013 compared with 88 deaths \u2013 57 Muslims, 28 Buddhists, and three with unidentified religious affiliation \u2013 in the same period in 2022. Insurgents reportedly conducted six simultaneous attacks at the end of Ramadan, resulting in multiple injuries.\n\nWith government representatives, U.S. embassy officials regularly advocated greater protection of refugees and asylum seekers, specifically including those fleeing religious persecution and violence. The Ambassador and embassy officials regularly met with religious leaders and scholars, international NGOs, academics, and representatives of faith-based organizations to discuss religious pluralism and tolerance as well as the plight of refugees fleeing religious violence. The Ambassador and other embassy officials frequently visited religious sites of local significance and engaged in discussion with religious leaders on issues related to tolerance and diversity. The embassy awarded multiple grants to NGOs in the Deep South for projects focusing on religious and ethnic diversity and inclusion, youth engagement, community building, and digital literacy/disinformation training. Embassy officials led quarterly virtual conversations with faith leaders, bringing together academics, religious leaders, community organizers, and youth influencers to create new connections, share perspectives on religious freedom issues, and consider future collaboration. On March 29, the Ambassador visited the Deep South and hosted an iftar with local religious leaders.",

The constitution names the Evangelical Lutheran Church (ELC) as the country\u2019s established church, granting it some privileges and funding not available to other religious groups.  The Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs is responsible for granting official status to religious groups other than the ELC through recognition by royal decree (for groups recognized prior to 1970) or through official registration.  Congregations are not required to register by law, although registration is required to receive tax benefits.  Religious communities must comply with annual reporting requirements to maintain government recognition.\n\nPursuant to the government\u2019s 2022 action plan to combat antisemitism, authorities released two reports during the year that explored Danish research into antisemitism and determined that there was very little research in the country on the subject, either on historical antisemitism or on the \u201cnew\u201d antisemitism generated by contempt for Israel.  In December, Nordic Safe Cities, a beneficiary of funding from the government\u2019s plan to combat antisemitism, released a study in cooperation with the Jewish Information Center detailing online antisemitism in Denmark from May 2021 to May 2023.  In consultation with the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Jewish Community in Denmark, authorities continued to provide security for sites considered to be at high risk of a terrorist attack, including Copenhagen\u2019s synagogue, community center, and one school.\n\nIn January, an 11-year-old student was suspended from a private \u201cfree school\u201d for wearing a headscarf to school.  The school had banned religious symbols and articles of clothing and suspended the girl when she refused to remove her scarf.  A parliamentarian publicly supported the school\u2019s decision and praised the school system\u2019s stance on religious symbols and clothing, stating the rule should be expanded to include all public schools.  In response to a request by Danish People\u2019s Party members, the Danish Institute of Human Rights (DIHR) stated a proposed expansion of the 2018 face veil ban would disproportionately target Muslim women and girls who wear scarves or other coverings in school.  Authorities continued to implement the government\u2019s action plan under the General Housing Act to eliminate what it termed \u201cparallel societies\u201d by 2030 to better integrate citizens and noncitizen residents.  The DIHR found the plan discriminatory and recommended authorities not include residents\u2019 ethnic backgrounds in parallel society criteria.\n\nIn response to Quran burnings in front of embassies of Muslim-majority countries, on December 7, parliament voted to amend the penal code to criminalize the \u201cinappropriate treatment of a text that has a significant religious importance to a recognized religious community, or an object, that appears to be such a text.\u201d  Several groups criticized the law, claiming it limits freedom of speech and expression.\n\nThe then-U.S. Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues visited the country in October to mark the 80th anniversary of the escape of Danish Jews during the Nazi occupation to neutral Sweden.  The U.S. Ambassador and other embassy officials engaged with the Minister of Justice to discuss Quran burnings and with the Ministry\u2019s Security Office Number 1 to discuss the country\u2019s antisemitism action plan and with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office for Freedom of Religion or Belief to discuss efforts to combat antisemitism and hate crimes.  The Ambassador and other embassy officials visited several mosques, including a mosque led by the country\u2019s first female imam, to emphasize U.S. support for religious freedom.  Embassy officials also visited a number of Jewish community leaders underscoring U.S. support for religious freedom and expressed concern for the rising antisemitism in Denmark and around the world.  The Ambassador hosted an interfaith iftar to mark the end of Ramadan, bringing together members of the religious community, government officials, NGO partners, activists, and members of the press.  Embassy officials also participated in multiple Holocaust Remembrance events. ",

There were instances of government officials using terms widely considered to be slurs to describe ethnic Albanians, who are overwhelmingly Muslim.  In 2022, the Federation of Jewish Communities elected Aleksandar Albahari as its president.  The Ministry of Justice, however, was unable to register Albahari as the legal representative of the federation because of a legal case pertaining to the 2018 election of Igor Ginzberg as the federation\u2019s president.  The federation did not make legally required payments to Holocaust survivors during the year due to an impasse that stemmed from the federation\u2019s leadership disputes.  The government provided a large amount of money to the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC) for refurbishment of the Temple of St. Sava, which representatives of some religious groups said constituted privileged treatment of the SOC.  During the year, authorities continued to return heirless and unclaimed properties seized during the Holocaust and religious properties confiscated in 1945 or later to religious groups.  The government continued to develop a Holocaust memorial center at Staro Sajmiste, the site of a World War II-era German concentration camp in Belgrade.\n\nIn late January, an unknown individual drew a swastika and a crossed-out Star of David on the bus station and several other locations in Sombor.  On January 30, an unknown individual drew a swastika and a crossed-out Star of David at the entrance to the Sephardic Jewish cemetery in Belgrade.  Some members of the media and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) criticized a procession during which participants carried relics of the late SOC Bishop Nikolaj Velimirovic, an antisemite and Hitler sympathizer.  Nationalist groups used social media to spread antimigrant and anti-Muslim messages.  Many smaller and nontraditional religious groups reported some public bias and discrimination against their members.  The head of the country\u2019s Regulatory Body for Electronic Media Olivera Zekic posted a photograph of herself in a Nazi uniform on her Telegram channel profile in December, later saying she did so \u201cpurely for provocation.\u201d  According to an analysis done by Radio Free Europe, the photograph showed Zekic\u2019s head photoshopped onto a colorized picture of Reinhard Heydrich, one of the chief architects of the Holocaust.\n\nU.S. embassy officials engaged a variety of government ministries and offices to advocate for religious freedom and tolerance, continued interfaith dialogue, and the protection of religious sites throughout the country.  The embassy continued to encourage the accurate presentation of history at the planned Holocaust memorial center in Belgrade and emphasized the importance of continued restitution of Holocaust-era heirless and unclaimed Jewish property.  In September, the Ambassador hosted a lunch with a range of religious leaders and discussed the importance of interreligious dialogue.  Embassy officials met with representatives from a wide range of religious groups, including the SOC, Roman Catholic Church, multiple Protestant groups, and the Muslim and Jewish communities.  Embassy officials continued to use social media and other public outreach tools to advocate for religious freedom and tolerance.  In January, the Ambassador participated in a ceremony commemorating International Holocaust Remembrance Day.  The embassy amplified the Ambassador\u2019s participation in this event via social media.",

In September, the government enacted the Marriages Act that prohibits marriage under the age of 18.  The act also explicitly recognizes the roles of faith leaders practicing Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and \u201cany religion\u201d to solemnize marriages according to the rites of their faiths.\n\nAccording to one faith leader, security services targeted religious officials who criticized the government, and while the government respected freedom of worship, it did not respect freedom of speech, forcing some religious leaders to self-censor.  In September, President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa implored Parliament to prioritize finalizing amendments to the Private Voluntary Organization (PVO) Act.  If passed, the amendments would require all trusts, including faith-based organizations, to register as PVOs.  Some religious leaders said they planned to urge Parliament to reject the amendments.  In the lead up to the August elections, government and Zimbabwe African National Union \u2013 Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) leaders embarked on an outreach campaign to religious groups to bolster support for their electoral victory.  A Christian leader stated in some cases the government coerced religious leaders to invite the President and other senior government and party officials to religious gatherings where they sometimes pledged their electoral support.  Religious leaders were active in calling for peace around and monitoring the elections.\n\nThroughout the year, religious leaders continued regular interfaith engagement across the Zimbabwe Interreligious Council (ZIRC) interfaith platform, which convenes Christians and Muslims to \u201cpromote peace, reconciliation, good governance and holistic human development through interfaith action and collaboration.\u201d\n\nIn meetings with the government, U.S. embassy officials raised concerns about the likely impacts of the draft amendments to the PVO bill on faith-based and other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and their ability to provide essential services, if enacted in its current form.  In December, officials from the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Office of International Religious Freedom visited the country and met with a broad range of religious leaders to discuss issues of religious freedom and understand their priorities.",

The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) rejected the request of Boris Bojovic, the deputy of MOC Metropolitan Mihailo, for the MOJ to name him as MOC Metropolitan in the state register of religious communities, thereby replacing Metropolitan Mihailo.  In September, Bojovic led a public gathering to remove Mihailo from the leadership of the MOC and elect himself as leader.  Metropolitan Mihailo immediately denounced the move as legally void and stated publicly that he remained the MOC\u2019s leader.  The Islamic Community of Montenegro (ICM) criticized then caretaker prime minister Dritan Abazovic, stating there was a disparity in government funding for religious communities, with the ICM receiving significantly less than the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC).  The MOC said the government took no action during the year to resolve the dispute between the SOC and MOC over ownership of disputed religious sites.  The city of Pljevlja\u2019s assembly voted in September to replace the town\u2019s liberation day holiday with the Christian Orthodox Saint Petka holiday, sparking criticism from the ICM and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that the decision undermined the country\u2019s secular character, as defined in the constitution, and that it marginalized Muslims.  In October, in the leadup to the country\u2019s national census, SOC Patriarch Porfirije gave an address at Podgorica\u2019s Christ\u2019s Resurrection Church in which he urged the faithful to identify their ethnicity as Serb on the census.  Porfirije\u2019s call engendered media backlash and opposition party criticism, with observers framing it as SOC interference in domestic politics and an extension of Serbian government meddling that aimed to interfere with the integrity of the planned census.  The SOC said the Ministry of Interior approved visas for clergy newly arrived in the country but did not address existing cases of clergy denied residence permits by the previous government.\n\nIn April, the ICM said an assault on two Bosnia and Herzegovina athletes visiting the country was religiously motivated, while other sources said the altercation was triggered by a traffic accident involving the athletes.  ICM representatives said the four assailants, all local minors, beat the two Bosnian players, injuring one severely and causing minor injuries to the other.  Following the attack, prosecutors filed criminal charges for engaging in violent behavior and causing serious bodily harm.  Throughout the year, the ICM reported numerous instances of anti-Muslim rhetoric, including chants at public events and school ceremonies celebrating war criminals, including Ratko Mladic, convicted of crimes against humanity, and genocide against Muslims.  According to the ICM, the Ministry of Education did not respond to these incidents.\n\nThe Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officials met with government officials responsible for religious issues at the Ministry of Justice and at local mayoral and municipal offices throughout the country as well as with officials in other ministries, including the Prime Minister\u2019s office.  Engagement included discussion of relations between the government and religious groups, the government\u2019s implementation of the amended religious freedom law and the general treatment of religious groups under it, the increase in societal and religious tensions, and advocacy for religious tolerance and property restitution for religious groups.  The Ambassador and other embassy officials met with representatives of all principal religious groups.

It states all persons are equal before the law and prohibits discrimination on grounds of religious belief. According to the constitution, sharia is the principal source of legislation, although the judicial system applies both sharia and civil law, depending on the case. The penal code and electronic crimes law contain prohibitions on blasphemy, proselytizing by non-Muslims, and acts the government interprets as provoking religious hatred, discrimination, or insulting religions.\n\nA new federal law that took effect in November prohibits all forms of proselytization and expands blasphemy provisions from previous legislation, prohibiting the denigration of the tenets of any religion recognized by the government as opposed to only Abrahamic faiths. It also forbids inciting religious, racial, and ethnic tensions and any undertaking viewed by the state as undermining public order. Beginning November 30, federal law expands the requirement for non-Muslim religious groups to obtain licenses for their houses of worship and places them under the purview of the federal Ministry of Community Development. The law retains the authority of each emirate-level regulator to license and oversee houses of worship in their respective jurisdictions. The federal government had not promulgated the law\u2019s implementing regulations by year\u2019s end.\n\nThe government, having designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization in 2014, continued to restrict the activities of organizations and individuals allegedly associated with al-Islah, a Muslim Brotherhood affiliate. Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist who, according to Human Rights Watch, has been in prison since 2017 for advocating political inclusion, was accused by the government of promoting \u201ca sectarian and hate-filled agenda.\u201d According to an international human rights organization, at least 62 political detainees remained in detention after completing their sentences, including Mohammed al-Roken, a human rights lawyer arrested in 2012 and sentenced to 10 years in prison for his defense of alleged members of al-Islah. On December 7, the Public Prosecution referred 84 defendants to the Abu Dhabi Federal State Security Court of Appeal on charges of establishing a clandestine organization to commit acts of violence and terrorism in the country, stating that the defendants were mostly members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Among the defendants were individuals already imprisoned on other convictions or in government custody based on political activities, including Mansoor, al-Roken, and Khalaf al-Rumaithi. Representatives of non-Islamic faiths said registration and licensing procedures and requirements for minority religious groups remained unclear in all emirates. The government continued to permit Shia Muslims to observe Ashura in private but not in public.\n\nIn January, the government announced it would begin teaching about the Holocaust in history classes in primary and secondary schools, becoming the first Arab nation to do so, in the 2023-24 school year. In February, Abu Dhabi inaugurated the government-sponsored Abrahamic Family House, with a mosque, a church, and the country\u2019s first purposely built synagogue located on one site and representing the three Abrahamic faiths.\n\nAccording to non-Muslim religious community representatives, there was a high degree of societal tolerance for minority religious beliefs and traditions, particularly for those associated with houses of worship officially recognized by the federal or local emirate governments. Although conversion from Islam was strongly discouraged, conversion to Islam was encouraged. In some cases, organizations reported that hotels, citing government regulatory barriers, were unwilling to rent space for non-Islamic religious purposes, such as weekly church services. Jewish community leaders reported a rise in antisemitic incidents on social media and in schools following the October 7 Hamas attacks. Jewish community leaders said religious services open to the public in Dubai were suspended as of October 7 out of an abundance of caution. Services in Abu Dhabi continued to be held at the Abrahamic Family House synagogue, although community members noted a sharp decrease in attendance.\n\nThe Secretary of State visited the Abrahamic Family House on October 14 and subsequently discussed his visit with the UAE President. The Ambassador, visiting U.S. government officials, and embassy and consulate general officers engaged government officials throughout the year on efforts to support religious diversity, inclusiveness, and tolerance and discussed licensing procedures and regulatory practices involving religious and religiously affiliated groups. To mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day in January, the embassy supported an event organized by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and Zayed University that featured a Holocaust survivor. During the year, the Ambassador, visiting senior U.S. government officials, and other embassy and consulate general officers met regularly with representatives of religious organizations and other groups associated with minority religious communities, including Christian church leaders, Sikh and Hindu community leaders, Jewish community representatives, and the Baha\u2019i and Bohra Muslim communities. Embassy and consulate general officers also met with Islamic organizations and discussed the promotion of religious tolerance and emphasized the U.S. government\u2019s commitment to religious freedom. The then Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires attended the inauguration of the Abrahamic Family House in February along with other embassy personnel in addition to visiting the construction site of Abu Dhabi\u2019s Hindu temple in June and meeting leaders of the Hindu community.",

A group lacking the minimum 50,000 adult adherents required to obtain status as an official religious group may register as a civic association to function; in doing so, however, it may not identify itself officially as a religious group.\n\nGroups that were unable to meet the minimum threshold of adherents to be registered as religious groups continued to consider this requirement discriminatory. These unregistered groups remained unable to establish schools or teach their faith at schools, were ineligible for government subsidies, and their services were not recognized by the government as religious activities. In March, parliament failed to pass a law enabling registration of religious groups with fewer than 50,000 adherents, with some members of parliament (MPs) making derogatory statements about religious minorities during parliamentary debate. The Old Catholic Mission of the Union of Utrecht in Slovakia stated the President agreed the registration requirements were \u201cunreasonably high,\u201d but that she decided not to submit a motion to the Constitutional Court to reconsider the issue because she anticipated a negative decision.\n\nState authorities continued to prosecute individuals for crimes the law defined as extremist, including defaming minority religious beliefs and denying the Holocaust. In March, a court in Banska Bystrica sentenced Sheila Szmerekova to three years in prison for extremism and the crime of making dangerous threats against Muslims. The Islamic Foundation in Slovakia stated the conviction constituted the first involving a hate crime against Muslims in the country. In August, following a criminal investigation into mandatory religious practices employed at a government-run orphanage in Trnava, the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office ordered the government to terminate the orphanage\u2019s \u201cspiritual program\u201d immediately. In June, the mayor of Bratislava met for the first time since assuming office in 2018 with representatives of the Muslim community, which remained unable to register as a religious group because of the threshold requirement and instead was registered as a civic association, to discuss hate crimes against the community, its inability to establish a mosque, and issues with burial grounds. During the meeting, the mayor expressed his commitment to supporting all vulnerable communities.\n\nGovernment officials and MPs from both the government coalition and opposition parties continued to make anti-Muslim statements. In messaging ahead of the September parliamentary election, leaders from across the political spectrum engaged in rhetoric portraying undocumented migrants, predominantly from Muslim-majority countries, as a serious and imminent threat to security and public order, calling them criminals and terrorists. Representatives and supporters of the Kotlebovci \u2013 Ludova strana Nase Slovensko (Kotleba\u2019s \u2013 People\u2019s Party Our Slovakia) (LSNS) party and the Republika party continued to make statements widely considered to be antisemitic and glorifying the World War II-era Nazi-collaborator fascist government. In February, parliament failed to pass a law requiring municipalities to rename streets named after representatives of the World War II and communist regimes. The chairman of the Central Union of Jewish Religious Communities expressed disappointment over failure of the law to pass and called on MPs who voted against or abstained not to attend Holocaust commemoration events in the future. In November, the government eliminated the position of government plenipotentiary for freedom of religion or belief, stating the role was no longer \u201cjustified and effective.\u201d\n\nIn April, a court convicted a man of extremism and online stalking motivated by antisemitism and sentenced him to a five-year suspended prison sentence. The Muslim community continued to report anti-Muslim hate speech on social media, which it mostly attributed to inflammatory public statements by politicians, particularly in the run-up to September parliamentary elections, and negative portrayals of Islam and Muslims in the media. A member of the Muslim community criticized as xenophobic rhetoric on social media blaming Arabs collectively for supporting violence following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel. Organizations that media outlets described as far right continued to publish material on and to commemorate the World War II-era, Nazi-allied Slovak state, and to praise its leaders. Social media analysts and the National Criminal Agency noted an uptick in antisemitic rhetoric on social media in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Research published in April by the Open Society Foundation suggested that while the level of awareness of the Holocaust had increased and support for the wartime regime had decreased since 2013, one third of respondents reported having encountered Holocaust denial, particularly on the internet and social media, and one quarter said it was time to stop commemorating the Holocaust.\n\nIn discussions with government officials, the U.S. Ambassador and other embassy officers raised the treatment of religious minorities and the difficulties they faced regarding registration as well as the need for measures to counter widespread antisemitism and anti-Muslim sentiment. The Ambassador and other embassy officers also repeatedly used private and public events as well as social media to highlight the importance of religious freedom and tolerance in society and the importance of countering hate speech and violence towards religious minorities. Embassy officials, including the Ambassador, met regularly with registered and unregistered religious organizations and NGOs to raise the issue of hate speech and promote tolerance.",

CRL chairperson David Mosoma called for eliminating illegal initiation schools.\n\nIn December, the National Assembly passed a hate crime and hate speech bill that included religion as a factor; President Cyril Ramaphosa had not signed it into law at the end of the year. Some political opposition parties and civil society organizations said the bill\u2019s definition of hate speech was overly broad. In November, the National Assembly passed a bill that would require religious groups to register formally with the government; at year\u2019s end, the President had not signed the measure into law. Several religious groups said the registration requirement would restrict their religious freedom. A bill that would harmonize civil and customary marriage rules and recognize Muslim, Hindu, and other religious marriages remained pending before parliament at year\u2019s end. Following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, some political leaders participated in pro-Palestine rallies that included antisemitic chants and made statements supporting Hamas. On October 23, in a speech in front of the Israeli embassy, Economic Freedom Front (EFF) leader Julius Malema likened Hamas to African National Congress (ANC) anti-apartheid freedom fighters and said, \u201cHamas is doing nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nThe South African Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD) recorded 207 antisemitic incidents during the year, including violence, verbal threats in-person and online, destruction of Jewish property, and antisemitic graffiti, compared with 68 incidents in 2022. Seventy percent of antisemitic incidents occurred following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, the majority in Johannesburg and Cape Town. After October 7, pro-Palestinian groups held numerous anti-Israel protests at which protesters shouted antisemitic slogans, such as \u201cone Jew, one bullet.\u201d Civil society organizations expressed concern about a boycott campaign against Jewish-owned businesses that various Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) organizations intensified after October 7. In November, the group South African Jews for a Free Palestine (SAJFP) joined the Muslim Judicial Council, ANC, and other organizations in a pro-Palestinian march in Cape Town. On December 8, the second night of Hanukkah, SAJFP hosted an interfaith Shabbat service at the Claremont Main Road Mosque in Cape Town dedicated to Palestinian rights.\n\nU.S. embassy officials met with officials from the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Development, and the Office of the Presidency to discuss religious freedom issues. Embassy officials met with religious groups and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including Muslim, Christian, and Buddhist representatives, to gauge and discuss issues of religious freedom.

The government continued to provide extensive support for schools operated by religious groups, including paying and certifying all teachers.\n\nThe CCL continued to convey concerns from religious leaders about crime in the country, which it assessed was related to a lack of employment and educational opportunities for youth, aggressive gang activity, and gender-based violence.\n\nDuring the year, the U.S. Ambassador hosted an iftar, where she highlighted the importance of religious tolerance.  The embassy used social media to highlight religious freedom issues and engaged with the CCL general secretary throughout the year.",

        "summary": "The constitution provides citizens with \u201cthe right and freedom to believe or not to believe in religion.\u201d The government officially recognizes four religions: Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and the Baha\u2019i Faith, with Buddhism paramount. Decree 315, rather than codified law, sets forth rules for religious practice and minimum land requirements for building houses of worship and defines the government as the final arbiter of permissible religious activities.\n\nReligious leaders continued to state that while authorities in urban areas and in some districts had a strong understanding of laws governing religious activities, improper restrictions on religious freedom remained prevalent in rural areas. Reports continued of local authorities, especially in isolated villages, discriminating against and sometimes expelling followers of minority religious groups, particularly Christians, for refusing to renounce their faith. Roman Catholic officials reported continued monitoring by government officials of their services in some locations. There was no information on the investigation into the abduction, beating, and killing in October 2022 of Christian convert and Lao Evangelical Church (LEC) Pastor Sy Sengmanee in Khammouane Province, although authorities said the case remained under investigation. In September and October, local officials in rural areas in Sa Mouay District, Salavan Province, reportedly destroyed homes of Christian converts across four villages, forcing families to leave. According to sources, officials offered land to some of the families for rebuilding homes in one village but without other compensation. Media outlets reported that in February, villagers in Luang Namtha Province forced more than a dozen Christian convert families and a pastor from their homes, and that officials\u2019 attempts to intervene and mediate the dispute to allow families to return were unsuccessful. In October, Sa Mouay District authorities reportedly forced eight or more families from three villages and destroyed their homes following their conversion to Christianity. LEC officials reported local authorities pressured 79 Christian families from Xaybuathong, Yommalath, and Bualapha Districts in Khammouane Province to sign documents renouncing their faith. In Sekong Province, Christian residents reported discrimination in education, housing, and access to public services and facilities. No new religious groups registered successfully with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA). While some unregistered groups said they could practice without interference in house churches, others said local authorities in many areas considered group worship in homes illegal.\n\nReligious leaders continued to state that Decree 315 established onerous requirements sometimes used to restrict travel for religious purposes. Christian groups continued to say burdensome property requirements hindered construction or renovation of houses of worship in some areas but that government approvals were granted in others. Construction of a Seventh-day Adventist church that commenced in October 2022 continued in Champasak Province, with official approval, although the group\u2019s parcel of land there was smaller than the legal minimum requirement. Some members of minority religions concealed their religious affiliation in order to join and avoid discrimination in the ruling Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party (LPRP), the government, and the military. The government continued to train provincial officials to implement Decree 315 and other laws governing religion, albeit in fewer locations than prior years, and full and correct implementation remained inconsistent across locations. The government stated its plan was to mandate local officials, rather than national officials, to conduct most future Decree 315 training.\n\nAccording to government and religious group members, tensions continued in rural areas among animists, Buddhists, and growing Christian communities. Reports continued, for example, of some villagers preventing the burial of Christians in public cemeteries. In southern provinces, however, Catholic officials reported progress in interfaith cooperation and community-building.\n\nU.S. embassy officials regularly raised specific religious freedom cases and issues regarding cumbersome regulations, including registration procedures, with the government and LPRP officials, and continued to encourage the use of open dialogue and conflict resolution to settle them. In official meetings, the Ambassador promoted religious freedom as a universal human right and offered U.S. consultation to the government as it began the process of codifying the provisions of Decree 315 into law. Embassy officials met regularly with leaders from a wide variety of religious groups and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to understand better the problems faced by members of minority religious groups.",

Laws and policies grant the GOC unique privileges.  In September, parliament adopted a new defense code, which, according to the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Tolerance and Diversity Institute (TDI), could require non-GOC clergy to perform alternative non-military service, while GOC clergy are exempt from military and alternative service due to a long-standing constitutional agreement between the state and the GOC.\n\nIn May, the Supreme Court annulled a lower court decision that the government denial of permits to Muslims to build a mosque on land they owned was discriminatory and returned the case to the lower court for a retrial.  TDI reported the court found that some governmental discrimination between religions could be remedied by parliament abolishing or granting tax privileges to all religions.  NGOs and some Muslim community leaders again said the government continued to favor and influence the state-funded group All Muslims of All Georgia (AMAG).  In August, TDI partially appealed a 2022 ruling by the Tbilisi City Court in favor of two Seventh-day Adventist university applicants who challenged scheduling of required exams on Saturday, their holy day.\n\nTDI reported that due to the Tbilisi Court of Appeals ruling against it in a private lawsuit, the Evangelical Church of Georgia (ECG) was on the verge of losing the money collected by its parishioners to build its prayer house.  In November, the Supreme Court rejected the ECG\u2019s appeal of the ruling.  Between January and September, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses reported to the government nine religiously motivated incidents of physical violence and harassment.  During the year, the NGO Media Development Foundation documented 48 instances of religiously intolerant statements directed at Muslims and various other religious groups.  Some were of antisemitic character and targeted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nReligious leaders again said de facto authorities in the Russia-occupied Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which remained outside the administrative control of the central government, placed restrictions on some religious groups.  Both regions continued to ban Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.  The GOC and Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) recognized Orthodox churches in both regions as belonging to the GOC, but GOC officials stated de facto authorities in South Ossetia pressured GOC churches to merge with the ROC, while some religious figures in Abkhazia continued to support turning the region\u2019s Orthodox churches into autocephalous Abkhaz Orthodox Churches.  Sources said the ROC tacitly supported the autocephalic ambitions of breakaway churches without seeking formal recognition of their autocephaly from the GOC.  De facto authorities in South Ossetia declared GOC religious services illegal but permitted them in practice.  In Abkhazia, de facto authorities prohibited GOC clergy from entering the region.  Most GOC worshippers in Abkhazia were unable to travel to Tbilisi-administered territory to celebrate Orthodox Christmas or Orthodox Easter due to lacking Abkhazia \u201cpassports.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador and other embassy officials met with officials from the government to encourage government efforts to increase tolerance of minority religions and hold individuals accountable for discriminatory actions.  The Ambassador met with GOC Patriarch Ilia II and other senior GOC leaders throughout the country and stressed the importance of religious diversity and tolerance.

Religious minority groups again said the government\u2019s continued failure to create a framework discriminated against groups without conventions with the government. In September, Prime Minister Xavier Bettel announced a national action plan to fight antisemitism that included 19 specific measures aimed at raising awareness of and combatting antisemitism in society and shaping how the Holocaust would be remembered.

The constitution declares that the country is a secular state. The constitution and other laws provide for the right of individuals to choose and change their religion and to practice the religion of their choice.\n\nThe government, known as the Transitional Authorities (TA), generally maintained policies permitting the free practice of religion in areas it controlled, according to government officials and members of religious groups and associations. Nongovernmental organization (NGO) sources said state security forces illegally arrested and then rendered incommunicado religious leaders because they were from the Fulani ethnic group, which the NGOs said was often suspected of siding with terrorists because armed groups recruited within the mostly Muslim Fulani community. Because religion and ethnicity are closely linked, it was difficult to categorize most arrests as being solely based on religious identity, however, and the TA condemned the stigmatization of vulnerable communities, especially the Fulanis. Media reported that some Muslims were arrested for posting information on social media that the TA considered threatening. On January 20, Transition President Traore met with leaders of the Federation of Islamic Associations of Burkina (FAIB) and encouraged them to promote peace and social cohesion. In October, the speaker of the Transitional Legislative Assembly (ALT) said the ALT would pass a bill on religious freedom which the drafters said was designed to avoid abuses that could undermine efforts for peace and social cohesion, to combat what they called religious fanaticism, and to promote interreligious dialogue. That bill, which replaced a 2022 draft on religious liberty and related issues, remained pending at year\u2019s end. TA representatives said they were aware that action, including interfaith dialogue, was needed to combat hate speech and other activities affecting social cohesion.\n\nInternational and local media and NGOs reported that terrorist groups, armed insurgents, and militant jihadists expanded their control, continued their campaign of violence, and sometimes targeted places of worship or religious leaders. Domestic and transnational terrorist groups conducted increased attacks and inflicted more violence against civilians than in 2022, including numerous targeted killings based on religious identity, according to NGOs. They stated that the country experienced 67 percent of the militant Islamist-related fatalities in the Sahel region (8,800 deaths in Burkina Faso alone) in 2023. This was more than double the number of deaths in the country recorded in 2022, according to the African Center for Strategic Studies (ACSS). Militant Islamist groups, primarily Ansaroul Islam and other groups associated with Jamaat Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), laid siege to at least 36 towns and took control of more than half the country\u2019s territory.\n\nTerrorist groups, armed insurgents, and militant jihadists killed imams, other clergy, and worshippers while attacking and destroying mosques, churches, and animists\u2019 places of worship. In January, terrorists killed a Catholic priest in Sourou Province and killed Ahmadi Muslims at a mosque in Seno Province, when they refused to renounce their faith. In February, terrorists killed 60 Christians in Partiaga commune, including some who were praying during a Sunday Mass. In December, suspected JNIM militants killed approximately 100 persons, including Christians, at Basse in the commune of Bekuy. Although the identity of those responsible for many attacks was unknown, observers attributed most attacks to Ansaroul Islam, Islamic State in Greater Sahara (ISIS-GS), and JNIM, all designated by the U.S. government as terrorist organizations. Media and international NGOs reported that violent extremist organizations enforced their ideology and interpretation of Islamic law in the region with the threat of violence for noncompliance.\n\nHuman rights organizations and religious groups continued to express concern that religiously targeted violence harmed the traditional peaceful coexistence of religious groups in the country. Academic and other observers stated the mostly Muslim ethnic Fulani community continued to be stigmatized because of its perceived sympathy for terrorists. Ahmadi Muslims said their community was frequently rejected by other Muslim communities who deemed Ahmadis not to be Muslims. Some religious and civil liberties groups said religious rhetoric was used more frequently in political speech, in particular by Muslim supporters of Transition President Traore. In June, members of major national Christian organizations called on their leaders to speak up about what they stated they viewed as \u201cdangerous\u201d social and political changes taking place in the country. The Christian leaders said the TA was quietly \u201cnurturing a growing divide\u201d among religious groups into those supporting the TA and those against. They also said that some Muslims viewed Transition President Traore as a \u201cmessenger from God\u201d who would bring \u201cjustice\u201d to Muslims who said they believed they were treated unfairly by the previous government, which they characterized as Christian-dominated. In September, representatives of civil society organizations and journalists said they were worried about growing religious (Muslim) influence within the government, which they believed was slowing down the return to democracy.\n\nIn October, a group of Muslim intellectuals met to discuss violent extremism, radicalization, and terrorism in the country and how Muslim leaders could contribute to the return of peace. Members of the Burkinabe Muslim Community (CMB), the Catholic Archdiocese of Ouagadougou, and the Federation of Evangelical Churches continued to state that despite an increase in religiously motivated attacks, religious tolerance remained a common value, citing numerous examples of families of mixed faiths and religious leaders attending each other\u2019s holidays and celebrations. Members of the largest religious communities promoted interfaith dialogue and tolerance through organizations such as the FAIB, which conducted campaigns promoting interfaith dialogue throughout the country.\n\nU.S. embassy officials discussed the continued increase in religiously motivated attacks, particularly in the Center East, Boucle du Mouhoun, Sahel, and East Regions with a wide range of TA agencies and officials, including in the Office of the President and the Directorate General for Religious, Customary, and Traditional Affairs (DGARCT). Throughout the year, the Ambassador met with imams and other Muslim leaders, as well as Catholic and Protestant leaders, to reinforce U.S. support for religious freedom and tolerance and to hear their concerns. In February, the embassy hosted a delegation from the Ahmadi Muslim community to discuss U.S. concerns about the stigmatization of religious minorities, including Ahmadis. In addition, embassy officers met with religious leaders to encourage and promote values of religious freedom, interfaith tolerance, and active civil dialogue on these subjects.

In July, authorities in Tra Vinh and Soc Trang Provinces arrested three Khmer Krom Buddhist advocates for \u201cabusing democratic freedoms.\u201d  In December, An Giang authorities tried and sentenced independent Hoa Hao Buddhist Nguyen Hoang Nam to eight years in prison for \u201cspreading anti-state materials\u201d by posting documents \u201cundermining policy on religious or national unity.\u201d  At year\u2019s end, eight H\u2019Mong Duong Van Minh followers remained in prison on charges of \u201cacting against persons on duty\u201d and \u201cviolating provisions on safety in crowded areas.\u201d  During the year authorities released seven others who were arrested in 2021-2022 on similar charges.  According to the Ministry of Public Security, as of March, nearly 8,000 Duong Van Minh followers had renounced their faith following intensive campaigns to do so in 2022 and early 2023.  By midyear, local authorities in several areas, including Tuyen Quang, Bac Can, and Thai Nguyen Provinces, said their localities were \u201ccompletely free\u201d from the \u201cDuong Van Minh evil-way religion\u2019s influence.\u201d  Following attacks by armed assailants on government buildings in Dak Lak Province on June 11 that left nine persons dead and which authorities described as terrorist attacks, authorities accused several religious freedom/ethnic minority rights advocates and NGOs in the United States and Thailand of involvement in the attacks.\n\nAuthorities recognized two new religious organizations after more than four years without any new recognitions.  Many religious groups continued to report that registration with local authorities remained difficult, particularly for new religious movements and groups with large numbers of ethnic minorities.  On December 29, the government issued Decree 95, effective March 30, 2024, which will provide new limits on the discretion of local authorities in implementing the Law on Belief and Religion and provides a mechanism for the central government to suspend religious groups for \u201cserious infractions\u201d of the law.  It also includes new requirements for receiving foreign funding.\n\nThere continued to be reports of conflicts between members of unregistered and registered or recognized religious groups or between believers and nonbelievers.  On August 26, members of the registered Cao Dai group of Long Thuan Commune, Ben Cau District of Tay Ninh Province reportedly pressured Lam Thi Dam, an independent Cao Dai adherent, to have her father\u2019s funeral ceremony conducted by the registered Cao Dai group instead of by her independent Cao Dai group.\n\nIn April, the U.S. Secretary of State visited St. Paul de Chartres Convent in Hanoi and met with the Catholic sisters, highlighting their child education work and feeding of the poor as examples of positive contributions of religious groups when able to function freely in society.  The Ambassador, the Consul General in Ho Chi Minh City, and other U.S. embassy and consulate general officials regularly urged authorities to allow all religious groups to operate freely.  They sought reduced levels of government intervention in the affairs of recognized and registered religious groups and urged an end to restrictions on, and harassment of, groups lacking recognition or registration.  They stressed to government officials that progress on religious freedom and human rights was critical to the bilateral relationship.  They advocated religious freedom in visits across the country, including to the Northwest Highlands, Mekong River Delta, and Central Vietnam.  With the Government Committee on Religious Affairs (GCRA), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security, and provincial and local authorities, U.S. government officials raised specific cases of abuses, as well as of government harassment, against Catholics, Protestant groups including independent Pentecostal groups, the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), independent Hoa Hao groups, independent Cao Dai groups, and ethnic minority house churches.  U.S. government officials called for the increased registration of church congregations around the country and for improvement in registration policies by making them more uniform and transparent.  They continued to urge the government to resolve outstanding land rights disputes fairly and peacefully with religious groups.  The Ambassador and other embassy and consulate general officials met with the leadership of both registered and unregistered religious groups and attended religious ceremonies to demonstrate support for religious freedom.\n\nOn December 29, 2023, in accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as amended, the Secretary of State placed Vietnam on the Special Watch List for having engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom.",

Similarly, the Ecclesia Risorum\u2019s (Church of Laughter\u2019s) appeal of the MOC\u2019s multiple denials of its registration applications was pending before the Supreme Administrative Court at year\u2019s end.  In April, the Supreme Administrative Court rejected an appeal filed by Path of Guru Jara (PGJ) against the MOC\u2019s registration denial.  In January, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) held an International Holocaust Remembrance Day commemoration dedicated to Jewish musician Alma Rose, who perished at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp.  In November, the MFA hosted the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance (IRFBA) ministerial conference with a focus on freedom of belief under authoritarian regimes.  The government continued to compensate religious groups for communal property confiscated by the communist regime and returned art objects seized from a Jewish entrepreneur in 1939 to his U.S.-based descendants.  The opposition Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) Party and its leader, Tomio Okamura, continued to publicly criticize Islam and Muslim migrants.\n\nThe government reported 25 antisemitic and no anti-Muslim incidents in 2022, compared with 35 and seven incidents, respectively, in 2021.  Local nongovernmental organization (NGO) In IUSTITIA reported one threat incident and two violent attacks against Muslims in 2022.

In addition to online hate speech, the 2022 incidents included two cases of property damage and 10 of harassment.  The chairman of the FJC stated, \u201cDespite the dramatic increase in the number of online antisemitic incidents, the cases of antisemitically motivated violence in the Czech Republic remained isolated\u2026\u201d  In November, representatives from more than 30 of the country\u2019s universities called on authorities and academic leaders to combat the rise of antisemitism in academia, and in December, the FJC noted a general increase in antisemitic expressions following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel, primarily online.\n\nIn November, during a visit to the country to lead the U.S. delegation to the IRFBA ministerial conference, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights discussed cooperation regarding religious freedom, democracy, and human rights with senior government officials, partners, and youth leaders.  U.S. embassy representatives discussed religious freedom issues, including religious tolerance, with MOC officials and the Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues at the MFA.  Embassy representatives discussed efforts to restore the former Jewish cemetery in Prostejov with local officials.  Embassy officials met with Jewish, Roman Catholic, and Protestant religious leaders to reaffirm U.S. government support for religious freedom and tolerance.

Under the constitution, the state funds privately-owned-and-managed primary schools, referred to as \u201cnational schools,\u201d most of which are affiliated with religious groups, including 88 percent affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThere were reports that some school authorities in Catholic national schools continued to give preferential treatment to students for participating in religious activities and told parents that, contrary to law, their children could not opt out of religion classes. In October, Atheist Ireland said that even if the government achieved its target of establishing 400 multidenominational national schools by 2030, many parents would still have no choice but to send their children to the local school, which would likely be under Catholic patronage. No government-funded multidenominational national schools opened during the year. A bill that would make provision for hate crimes and impose a heavier penalty for offenses committed with a hate element based on, among other things, the religious identity of the victim, remained pending in the upper house of parliament (Seanad Eireann) at year\u2019s end. Civil society organizations expressed support for it, but critics said the proposed legislation was overly broad and could lead to the criminalization of religious beliefs and church teaching. In January, Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar and other senior government officials participated in the National Holocaust Memorial Day commemoration on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. In response to the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Prime Minister and other high-level officials made statements against antisemitism and anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\nIn March, the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Irish Network against Racism (INAR) recorded 136 incidents of hate speech related to race and religion in 2022 (the latest data available), compared with 113 in 2021, of which three targeted Jews and four targeted Muslims. The NGO said hate incidents were underreported and that preliminary findings from 2023 indicated a worsening atmosphere for minority groups, in part fueled by the far-right\u2019s promotion of antimigrant sentiment. The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an independent statutory body, reported it received 25 complaints of employment discrimination based on religion or belief in 2022 (the latest data available), compared with 29 complaints in 2021. In the wake of the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, Jewish community leaders said that, while instances of antisemitic rhetoric increased at schools and online, there had been no physical attacks, and the non-Jewish community in general was supportive of the Jewish community. During the year, the NGO Holocaust Education Ireland provided teachers with educational materials and training to teach about the subject. In July, the NGO wrote the Minister of Justice to express concern about the newspaper Irish Light that regularly published antisemitic conspiracy theories. On July 28, approximately 1,000 Muslims performed prayers at an interfaith celebration to mark Eid al-Adha in Dublin\u2019s Croke Park. Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish community leaders as well as members of government attended.\n\nU.S. embassy officials discussed issues of discrimination and the integration of religious minorities into the community with the government.

The constitution states that sharia is a main source of legislation and that all individuals are equal before the law, regardless of religion.  The law prohibits the defamation of the three Abrahamic faiths (Islam, Judaism, and Christianity), publication or broadcast of material the government deems offensive to religious groups, and practices the government finds inconsistent with Islamic law.\n\nIn August, the National Assembly approved a new law allowing the cancellation of lifetime bans on voting or running for office imposed in 2016 on Kuwaitis convicted of insulting God, or the prophets, if the perpetrators complete a period of legal rehabilitation.  In July, state media reported that Kuwait participated alongside the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in preparing a draft resolution presented to the UN Human Rights Council that addressed religious hatred and desecration of holy sites and objects.  Kuwait\u2019s Permanent Representative to the United Nations told state media that the resolution aimed to eliminate all types of religious hatred based on discrimination, hostility, or violence.  The government continued to appoint and pay the salaries of Sunni imams and to provide the recommended full basic text for weekly sermons preached at Sunni mosques.  The government did not exercise the same oversight of Shia imams, although it paid the salaries of some Shia imams and mosque staff.\n\nMinority religious groups said they could worship in private spaces without government interference if they did not disturb their neighbors or violate laws regarding assembly and restrictions on proselytizing.  Some minority religious groups reported a continued lack of facilities for worship and difficulty obtaining permission to construct new ones as well as problems obtaining sufficient visas for clergy or visiting staff.  Authorities did not accredit any religious schools.  Shia leaders continued to report widespread discrimination in clerical and public sector employment.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) continued to censor materials referring to the Holocaust or Israel, encouraging students to study the Holocaust on their own using open-sourced education materials, such as the internet and news media.  Individuals continued to face societal pressure against converting from Islam, and some who had converted when outside the country said their families harassed them as a result.\n\nDuring a roundtable discussion with representatives from non-Abrahamic faith communities, participants noted that Kuwaiti officials generally exhibited tolerance towards the practice of their religions.  Notwithstanding, they expressed that the current administrative obstacles and burdens placed on these communities had led to a less favorable situation compared to the past.  One leader of a nonregistered church said his church wanted to register with the government but that there was no publicly available information on how to do so.  Religious communities that are not registered by the government cannot legally sponsor their clergy, officially open places of worship, or establish bank accounts, among other essential activities required for operation.  Church leaders estimated there were approximately over 100 unregistered churches operating in the country.  Antisemitic stereotypes often appeared in the media, as did statements critical of some Islamic views.  In October, 45 of the National Assembly\u2019s 50 members released a public, antisemitic statement urging countries not to normalize relations with Israel because \u201cJews usually renege on their promises.\u201d\n\nAt a December roundtable, embassy officials met with registered church leaders to discuss trends in the country regarding religious freedom.  In September, embassy officials met with Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs (MAIA) representatives regarding the ministry\u2019s efforts to promote religious tolerance, its relationship with religious minority groups, and the activities of its Center for the Promotion of Moderation.  Embassy officials also met often with Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and Public Authority of Manpower (PAM) representatives and raised administrative problems that several churches faced.   In a meeting with the Director of the Office of International Religious Freedom, MAIA senior officials emphasized that all persons residing in Kuwait had the freedom to practice their faith with tolerance and dignity.  They said the Council of Ministers had assigned the government to create a unified department dedicated to managing administrative affairs for minority faith groups.  Hotels and businesses continued to mark non-Islamic holidays, such as Christmas, Easter, and Diwali.

As of year\u2019s end, specific language in the proposal was not yet public. Members of minority faiths expressed some concern over any possible provisions of the proposed new constitution that would declare the nation a Christian country.\n\nMultiple religious groups, including Christian, Jewish, and Islamic, were registered in the country. Government sources stated there were no pending registration applications for other groups. The Ministry of Traditional Governance, Peace, and Ecclesiastical Affairs (MTGPEA) provided funding to churches to carry out social programs, such as a Christian care center for victims of domestic violence. In October, the government funded a 79-member interdenominational delegation to Jerusalem, an expense that some called a misplaced priority given other social needs.\n\nMembers of minority faiths continued to express concern that most citizens, who are predominantly Christian and Protestant, would likely support any efforts to declare the country a Christian nation.\n\nU.S. embassy representatives discussed religious tolerance and the proposed constitutional change to declare the country a Christian nation with government officials during the year. Embassy officials discussed with religious minorities whether groups believed they could freely exercise their religious beliefs. U.S. military chaplains and volunteers engaged with religious actors and congregations by participating in religious services, providing support in religious schools, and engaging in community outreach events in underserved and at-risk areas of greater Honiara. During November and December, the U.S. Naval Ship (USNS) MERCY visited the country for two weeks at a time, and provided medical support, some in cooperation with religious groups.",

The minister stated that the government never enforced restrictions on religious activities in schools.  Representatives of the Seventh-day Adventist Church continued to express concerns that some public and private universities did not grant students leave to observe their Sabbath on Saturday because Saturdays were part of the official work week.  Some Seventh-day Adventist workers employed by both public and private companies in El Progreso and Yoro faced pressure to work during their Sabbath.  Following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, however, some government officials made statements that were interpreted as antisemitic.\n\nMuslim leaders reported difficulties in observing Friday prayers because Friday is a workday.

The government restricted the distribution of non-Islamic religious materials as well as Islamic materials it deemed inconsistent with the Maliki school of Sunni Islam. In February, the government extradited Shia Muslim Hassan al-Rabea, a Saudi citizen, to Saudi Arabia. Twenty-three human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International, raised concerns in their joint statement to the Head of Government regarding al-Rabea\u2019s treatment in Saudi Arabia because of his religion. In August, the Oued-Zem Court of First Instance (trial court) sentenced blogger Fatima Karim to two years in prison and fined her 50,000 dirhams ($5,000) for insulting Islam. Police arrested her after she posted commentary on social media in which she reportedly made satirical comments about Quranic verses.

The court took up the case although one of the four \u2013 Maryam al-Nuami \u2013 had been pardoned by the Sultan and released in April.  Her pardon amounted to a commutation of her sentence and did not shield her from subsequent prosecution on other charges.  The court in August sentenced al-Nuami for a variety of related misdemeanors, but those charges were dismissed on appeal in December.  The Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs (MERA) formally approved registration for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Church of Jesus Christ) and the Sikh community and identified suitable, permanent places of worship for both groups.

The Ministry of Education continued to subsidize wages for teachers and support staff of schools managed by religious groups, but it reduced support for operational costs and school supplies.  According to two organizations, one representing Indigenous tribes and the other Maroon tribes, government policies for granting land titles in territories occupied by followers of these faiths hindered them from practicing their beliefs, of which worship of nature is a core component.  In February, President Chandrikapersad Santokhi and a delegation of ministers consulted with the Interreligious Council (IRIS) on establishing a National Dialogue to address critical issues facing the country.\n\nMembers of IRIS, a body encompassing two Hindu groups, two Muslim groups, and the Roman Catholic Church, continued to meet to discuss interfaith activities as well as the impact of government policies on society.  In February, IRIS and the Committee for Christian Churches issued statements condemning the violence and looting that broke out following antigovernment protests against austerity measures.  In response to the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, the Ahmadiyya Muslim-associated Suriname Islamic Association and the Israelite Community of Suriname signed a joint statement in which they denounced all actions leading to divisiveness in the country.\n\nDuring a May meeting with the Minister of Home Affairs, the Ambassador and a visiting senior Department of State official discussed U.S. government policy regarding the importance of protecting religious freedom.  The senior Department of State official and U.S. embassy officials also met with organizations representing Indigenous and Maroon communities.  During the meeting, the religious leaders discussed their ability to freely exercise their religious beliefs, and the Department of State official and embassy representatives reiterated U.S. government policy to promote religious freedom and tolerance.  In April, the Ambassador hosted an iftar, during which he highlighted Suriname\u2019s respect for religious diversity and freedom.  Throughout the year, the Ambassador attended services at different religious places of worship as part of interfaith efforts to support religious freedom, diversity, and tolerance.",

Security forces fired on the protesters, reportedly killing 57 and wounding at least 75, and arresting 158. One police officer was killed. Military tribunals convicted one military officer of murder in the incident and sentenced him to death; three officers were each sentenced to 10 years in prison. The tribunals convicted the FNJMN leader, a pastor, of murder and other charges and sentenced him to death; 63 other FNJMN members received sentences of death or 10-20 years\u2019 imprisonment on similar charges. All the death sentences were commuted to life in prison.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria-Democratic Republic of the Congo (ISIS-DRC), known locally as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, continued to attack civilians indiscriminately in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, on occasion targeting churches and religious leaders. The violence targeted all communities, but most victims were Christian, the religious majority. In January, ISIS-DRC/ADF detonated an explosive at a church baptism service in Kasindi, North Kivu Province, killing 16 and injuring at least 62. In March, the group killed more than 83 Christians, including children, in attacks on villages in North Kivu.\n\nJehovah\u2019s Witnesses reported attacks against their members in the interior provinces.

It provides for freedom of thought and expression \u201cwithin the limits of the law\u201d but does not mention freedom of religion, belief, or conscience.  The constitution states sharia is the source of all legislation, although it coexists with secular common law and civil code models of law in a hybrid legal system.  The law prohibits denunciation of Islam, conversion from Islam to another religion, and proselytizing directed at Muslims.  Apostasy is a capital offense, and blasphemy is punishable by fines or imprisonment.\n\nThe conflict that began in 2014 between the government and the Iran-backed Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah, whose revolutionary ideology is grounded in its interpretation of Zaydi Shi\u2019ism, continued throughout the year.  Government control was limited in much of the country\u2019s territory, which constrained its ability to address abuses of religious freedom, including those that security personnel, tribal leaders, or local military commanders committed in areas under its nominal control.  In 2022, the then UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief reported prominent Christian figures were subjected to intimidation or threats of being charged with apostasy, which carried the death penalty.\n\nThe nongovernmental organization (NGO) Freedom House stated that assassinations and other violent attacks on clerics had increased since the war began in 2015, and that combatants from all sides of the conflict had destroyed many religious buildings across the country.  The Aden Office of Religious Endowments reportedly issued directives requiring sermons not to open political, sectarian, or partisan divisions, while a Ministry of Endowments and Guidance October 9 directive instructed imams to devote Friday sermons to supporting the Palestinians in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict.  Authorities took actions against clerics who violated these directives.  The Houthis and some tribal authorities in Abyan, Lahij, and Ma\u2019rib continued to enforce a religiously based requirement that a male relative accompany women in public (known as a mahram requirement), which critics such as Amnesty International criticized as a violation of women\u2019s rights.  Government-affiliated media broadcast antisemitic content in numerous instances.\n\nDuring the year, the Houthis continued to control approximately one-third of the country\u2019s territory, including 70 to 80 percent of the population.  The NGO Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) reported 90 percent of the 1,100 recorded religious repression events that occurred in the country from January 2020 to March 2022 took place in Houthi-controlled areas.  ACLED stated most Houthi repression involved \u201cmoral policing,\u201d imposing Houthi ideology on the religious and educational sectors, and extracting religious \u201ctaxes.\u201d  The Houthis disproportionately targeted non-Muslim religious minorities but also suppressed Sunni-leaning rituals.\n\nAs of year\u2019s end, the Houthis continued to detain Jewish Yemeni citizen Levi Salem Musa Marhabi, believed to be the last Jew left in the country, whom they have held since 2016 and despite a 2019 order by a Houthi \u201ccourt\u201d for his release.  According to the Yemeni NGO Insaf Center for Defending Freedoms & Minorities, Houthi forces tortured Marhabi during his detention, leaving him partially paralyzed.  International NGOs reported that on May 25, Houthi forces raided a Baha\u2019i religious meeting and detained and disappeared 17 Baha\u2019is as part of what Human Rights Watch (HRW) called a systematic effort by the Houthis to persecute Baha\u2019is and force them into exile.  Houthi forces eventually released 12 of the 17 individuals.  According to ACLED, the Houthis targeted Christian converts through \u201cjudicial harassment on charges of apostasy\u201d as well as other extrajudicial means such as threats and assaults.  They imposed ideologically driven constraints on women\u2019s dress, freedom of movement, and access to employment, education, and health care.  The UN and NGOs said mahram requirements that female aid workers be accompanied by a male relative negatively impacted the delivery of humanitarian aid.\n\nIn January, a Yemeni politician and activist said Houthis used the employment code to indoctrinate the approximately one million \u201cpublic-sector employees\u201d under their control.  One social media news source reported on June 25 that Houthi militia members allegedly closed four mosques in Utmah District, west of Dhamar Governorate, and prevented citizens from performing prayers in them in retaliation for the residents\u2019 refusal to accept pro-Houthi preachers in those mosques.  Sources reported elementary school curriculum and textbooks in Houthi-controlled areas continued to reflect solely the Houthi understanding of Islam and to contain antisemitic and anti-Israel slogans and rhetoric.  Media, NGOs, and a UN panel of experts reported Houthi members again organized summer camps to indoctrinate students in Houthi ideology and recruit child soldiers.  Multiple media outlets throughout the year reported the Houthi leaders continued to use antisemitic rhetoric and Houthi-controlled media continued to broadcast antisemitic statements and sermons.\n\nAccording to the NGO Open Doors, Christians and other religious minorities were the most vulnerable in Houthi-controlled areas in the north and in rural areas in the south, where al-Qa\u2019ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) maintained a strong presence and ISIS-Yemen (ISIS-Y) also targeted Christians.  According to Freedom House, AQAP posed a threat to non-Sunni Muslim residents, particularly in the southeast.\n\nOpen Doors said pressure on Christians in all spheres of life, including education, employment, family life, and the ability to observe religious practices, was \u201cat extreme levels.\u201d  Converts faced death threats and risked banishment from their tribes if they did not return to Islam.  Open Doors reported Muslim humanitarian aid providers denied assistance to members of religious minority groups.  Multiple Yemenis posted antisemitic statements to social media during the year.\n\nThe Department of State suspended U.S. embassy operations in Sana\u2019a in 2015, and U.S. diplomatic operations regarding the country have since been coordinated by the U.S. Mission to Yemen, based in Saudi Arabia.  Due to security concerns arising from the conflict, the U.S. government had limited to no direct access to religious communities in the country during the year.  The U.S Mission to Yemen continued to monitor closely the conditions of religious minority detainees and to press for their release, maintain communication with religious contacts among the Yemeni diaspora communities, and promote freedom of religion or belief through social media.  The U.S. Ambassador to Yemen and the U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen spoke with foreign government officials, civil society organizations, and religious leaders during the year regarding Marhabi\u2019s years long detention and of Baha\u2019is detained in Sana\u2019a after the May 25 raid.\n\nOn December 29, 2023, the Secretary of State designated the Houthis as an \u201centity of particular concern\u201d under section 301 of the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-281) for having engaged in particularly severe violations of religious freedom.",

After the Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel on October 7, President Gabriel Boric sent a Chilean Air Force plane to Israel to assist evacuating Chilean citizens, prompting the president of the Jewish Community of Chile (CJCH) to express appreciation for the government\u2019s work to rescue Chileans in the conflict zone.  On September 5, Foreign Affairs Minister Alberto van Klaveren Stork and Minister Secretariat General of the Presidency Alvaro Elizalde attended a Tefilla (prayer) that the Valparaiso Region Jewish community and the president of the CJCH hosted.  At the event, Elizalde said, \u201cThis prayer is very important, because it accounts for the religious diversity that exists in Chile.

Media outlets reported that 23 churches in Araucania received arson threats during the year and that on August 15, the Malleco Mapuche Resistance group caused the burning of a church and other private property in Araucania as a result of their attack.  According to representatives from the Jewish community, antisemitic sentiment increased, particularly on social media, following the Hamas October 7 terrorist attack on Israel.  On October 19, unknown individuals vandalized Saint Michael Archangel Catholic Church in the southern Los Lagos Region.  The vandals wrote \u201cJesus is Palestinian\u201d in red and green writing that damaged the recently restored facade of one of the country\u2019s oldest churches.  On October 18, individuals from the Lautaro Youth Movement vandalized a synagogue in the southern city of Concepcion with graffiti and red paint writings on the exterior wall expressing support for Palestinians.

Political opponents, civil society groups, and some religious groups continued to object to the proposed amendment, saying the country did not have an exclusive ethnic or religious affiliation and the amendment could spark conflict among the largest faith groups. In August, the Supreme Court ruled the government could not confiscate land owned by the National Spiritual Assembly of Baha\u2019i to erect a monument to the country\u2019s Christian identity in Peace Park in Port Moresby. Some ministries continued to instruct civil servants to participate in weekly prayer devotionals, but authorities said individuals could opt out without repercussions. Members of parliament continued to provide government grants to religious groups in their constituencies to carry out their religious activities; all of these groups were Christian. On August 26, the National Day of Prayer and Repentance, Prime Minister Marape called on citizens to seek guidance from God as humble Christians.\n\nCivil society representatives and religious leaders said gender-based violence (GBV), including the killing of women and their daughters accused of sorcery, continued to increase, and that many perpetrators were not prosecuted because they had connections to senior government officials and societal leaders. In May, a parliamentary committee recommended enacting a law that would mandate police investigate allegations of GBV and sorcery accusation-related violence (SARV) even if a victim withdrew the complaint, noting that many SARV and GBV victims were reportedly paid to withdraw their complaints. In October, the committee presented its first report to parliament, including a study that found that on average, approximately 400 individuals were accused of sorcery each year, with 65 accused persons being killed. The committee also reported the health department recorded more than 100,000 cases of GBV within only a few years. In November, a local nongovernmental organization (NGO) said authorities arrested two individuals accused of SARV and charged them with willful murder.\n\nAccording to an August investigation of approximately 72 cases by Community Good, a program operated by the United Church in Hela Province, approximately 85 percent of those attacked for alleged sorcery were killed, while 5 percent feared being tortured and committed suicide. In September, villagers in Mumeng, Morobe Province, reportedly tortured a woman to death after a self-styled Christian prayer warrior accused her of being a witch.

Also in September, a representative introduced a bill to obligate those in positions of authority, including religious authorities, to report instances of sexual crimes committed against minors or individuals with disabilities. Catholic Church officials criticized the bill as an affront to religious freedom. Members of Protestant groups registered as secular associations continued to state their preference for a separate registration process that would specifically cover church construction and operation, permits to organize events, and pastoral access to hospitals and prisons for members of non-Catholic religious groups. The Constitutional Chamber received four claims of religious discrimination. Indigenous leaders raised concerns about a lack of adequate demarcation of Indigenous lands and overlap between Indigenous lands and national parks limiting access to areas connected to spiritual practices.\n\nIn February, the Catholic Church reached a settlement in a civil case of four individuals who stated they were sexually abused by a former Catholic priest. A UN study released in June found of the 1.4 million posts analyzed, 53,000, or approximately 2.5 percent, referenced religion. The study noted this represented a decrease of 31 percent compared to the previous year.

The Quebec Court of Appeal released Chaput on bail in October, pending his appeal. In June, two unknown individuals shot and killed Canadian citizen and prominent activist for the creation of an independent Sikh state in northern India Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside of a Sikh temple in British Columbia. The Prime Minister stated that there were \u201ccredible allegations\u201d Nijjar was killed by agents of the Indian government. An Alberta Court of Justice dismissed Public Health Act charges against the Pastor of Grace Life Church, who had refused in 2021 to comply with COVID-19 masking rules and capacity limits on worship services. A teacher at Londonderry Jr. High in Edmonton, Alberta, was recorded criticizing Muslim students for not participating in school Pride celebrations. In response, the school principal sent a message to the community condemning the views of the teacher and emphasizing that the school values diversity, acceptance, and inclusion. In January, the federal government announced the appointment of Amira Elghawaby as the first special representative on combating Islamophobia. Elghawaby advises the government regarding combatting discrimination and anti-Muslim hatred. Multiple provinces announced that they would incorporate mandatory Holocaust education into their curriculum starting in the 2025-26 school year. Quebec Education Minister Bernard Drainville issued a directive prohibiting prayer rooms or spaces in publicly funded schools in Quebec, in accordance with the province\u2019s secularism law. The directive did not apply to private schools.\n\nThroughout the year, there were multiple reports of individuals in several cities committing hate crimes against Jews and Muslims. In January, two students were charged with public incitement of hatred, mischief, and criminal harassment for engaging in antisemitic behavior at a high school. In March, a VIA Rail security guard told a Muslim man that he could not pray in the Toronto train station. In March, the Jewish community reported that swastikas were spray painted on a synagogue in Montreal. In March, a group of young men attacked a Sikh student in Kelowna, British Columbia.

In March, an Ontario court found Guilherme \u201cWilliam\u201d Von Neutgem to be not criminally responsible due to a mental disorder for the 2020 murder of Mohamed Aslim Zafis. In July, Mohammed Moiz Omar, a former Muslim, was sentenced to eight years in prison for violent behavior towards worshippers at an Islamic Center in Ontario.\n\nU.S. embassy and consulate general officers and other U.S. government officials emphasized with national and provincial governments the need for respect for religious freedom and diversity and reaffirmed the U.S. government\u2019s commitment to addressing discrimination and exclusion through the Roadmap for Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership. Embassy and other U.S. government officials met frequently with representatives from Global Affairs Canada to discuss issues of religious freedom in the country.

The law allows conscientious objectors to fulfill their service requirement by working as government employees for 36 months at correctional facilities.\n\nThe government continued to accept applications for conscientious objectors to military service to fulfill their mandatory duties through alternative service. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses leaders said the three-year length of alternative service seemed punitive compared to the shorter period of 18 to 21 months for military service and was contrary to international standards. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses stated that one member of their organization was imprisoned for conscientious objection to military service. An additional three conscientious objectors who refused both military service and alternative service were awaiting trial. As of September, alternative service personnel had filed 125 complaints with the Constitutional Court over the alleged punitive nature of alternative service, according to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses representatives.\n\nResidents in Daegu continued to oppose the building of a mosque. In April, protestors briefly blocked the site. Media outlets reported that construction of the mosque, for which ground was broken in December 2020, resumed in July.

In March, parliament enacted stricter rules and imposed additional documentation requirements that went into force on September 1, for Sephardic Jewish citizenship applications. During the year, authorities continued to investigate possible illegalities in the attribution of nationality to descendants of Sephardic Jews and related criminal charges filed against Daniel Litvak, rabbi of the Porto Israeli Community. Authorities charged Litvak in 2022 with using privileged knowledge and connections to secure citizenship for such descendants and related financial crimes; his trial remained pending at year\u2019s end. In July, a law that decriminalizes euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide went into effect over the objections of a wide range of religious groups.

Three Jehovah\u2019s Witness students remained out of school after having been expelled in November 2022 for not singing the national anthem during the weekly flag raising.  Muslim leaders continued to report that some Muslims encountered difficulty obtaining official documents and services because of their non-Malagasy-sounding names.  The leaders again said that at times government officials harassed and mocked Muslims and considered them to be foreigners, even when they possessed national identity cards.

The government continued to implement its action plans to counter antisemitism and anti-Muslim sentiment, providing financial support for efforts including teacher training, police hate crime reporting, and interreligious dialogue. Police announced an elevated threat against Jewish and Israel-related targets due to Hamas\u2019s October 7 terrorist attacks on Israel and Israel\u2019s response. Jewish community leaders filed several reports with police of antisemitic harassment and of violent threats and behavior, although they perceived inadequate police focus on investigations of the allegations. The government continued funding the Church of Norway.

A law, passed in June and to be effective in August 2024, would ban religious activity in schools, such as attending school-organized church services, although students could apply for an exemption from the ban to voluntarily participate in religious activities in school. The government also funded interfaith and dialogue groups, including The Council for Religious and Life Stance Communities in Norway (STL), the Christian Council, the Buddhist Council, and the Muslim Dialogue Network (MDN) to promote dialogue and tolerance. In July, the Ministry of Children and Families published proposed updates to law, including implementation procedures to enforce minimum 40-percent gender (male and female) representation in the administrative and governing bodies of religious groups, in addition to updates to membership requirements for religious groups to access state religious grants and to the ministry\u2019s basis for refusing grants. Religious groups raised concerns that the changes could target specific groups, affect their registration, and reduce the amount of received state subsidies. In December, parliament passed a law banning sexual orientation conversion therapy practices over the objections of certain religious groups that said the law would restrict religious freedom.\n\nThe Holocaust Center, the Jewish Community of Oslo (DMT), the Norwegian Palestinian Committee (PKN), the Jewish Museum of Oslo, and police all reported a significant increase in religiously motivated hate speech following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel and Israel\u2019s response. According to DMT and the Holocaust Center, growing antisemitic rhetoric had caused Jewish citizens to hide their identity to avoid threats or harassment. DMT reported a Jewish family\u2019s mezuzah was torn off the entrance to their home, and a secondary school student was threatened that his house would be bombed because his family was Jewish. Organizations, including Stop the Islamization of Norway (SIAN), Human Rights Service, and Document.no, continued to post anti-Muslim articles online or in print media.

Atheists and some converts from Islam expressed interest in resettlement abroad due to discrimination and threats of violence.  Converts from Christianity to Islam also reported social stigma from their families and Christian society.  Christian women married to Muslim men were more often stigmatized.  Nonbelievers reported societal intolerance and discrimination.  Religious leaders reported continued online hate speech directed towards religious minorities and those advocating religious moderation, frequently through social media, though some religious leaders believe there will be a reduction in such discourse due to provisions penalizing it in the cybercrimes law.

In May, former President Alejandro Giammattei signed an executive order to reduce the time required for religious groups to register. Although the constitution prohibits clergy from serving in executive office, an evangelical Protestant pastor ran for vice president in the June national elections, stating that, in his view, the provision in the constitution only applied to Catholic priests. The Supreme Court of Justice and Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) declined to consider constitutional challenges to the pastor\u2019s candidacy. Faith leaders continued to opine that the Presidential Commission on Religious Liberty commission should include Mayan Cosmovision representatives to make the commission fully inclusive and representative of the country\u2019s religious and societal diversity.\n\nMayan spiritual guides and practitioners reported continued societal discrimination and harassment, including accusations of witchcraft. They again reported that some evangelical Protestant congregations created obstacles restricting the ability of Mayan practitioners to worship. Some Catholic clergy and Mayan spiritual guides said they continued to receive anonymous threats, mostly on social media through internet trolls called \u201cnet centers,\u201d because of their association with environmental protection, pro-democracy, anticorruption, and human rights work.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador and other embassy officials engaged with government officials, religious groups, and civil society organizations to discuss issues of religious freedom, including threats against religious leaders and access for Mayan spiritual practitioners to their spiritual sites. In his meetings with representatives of Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, and other faith traditions, the Ambassador reiterated the U.S. government\u2019s commitment and dedication to freedom of religion or belief. During a November trip to the Western Highlands, the Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires met with Indigenous leaders to understand their traditional governing structures, civic participation, and Indigenous spiritual beliefs.

More than a year after his 2022 release, Copt and human rights activist Ramy Kamel Saied Salib remained under a travel ban. Authorities originally arrested Kamel in 2019 following his application for a Swiss visa to speak at a UN forum in Geneva on minority rights and charged him with joining a banned group and spreading false news.

In March, al-Azhar issued a fatwa stating that a four-year-old child named Shenouda raised by Coptic Christian parents after being abandoned by his birth parents could be considered Christian; the child subsequently was returned from government care to his adoptive Coptic parents. During the year, civil society groups and Coptic organizations reported at least eight cases of alleged abduction and forced conversion of Coptic women and girls. In several of these cases involving minors, security services helped locate and return the girls to their families.

The Ministry of Awqaf organized an international conference in September, which, according to Minister Mohamed Mokhtar Gomaa, addressed the challenge of \u201cliberating mosques from the control of extremist groups.\u201d On January 21, local media reported that President Sisi issued directives to plan for expanded mosque construction to spread \u201ctrue religion nationwide\u201d while ensuring proper selection of mosque sites and \u201crightsizing\u201d mosque capacity based on local populations. In March, President Sisi inaugurated the Islamic Cultural Center in the New Administrative Capital, a component of the Mosque of Egypt, the world\u2019s second-largest mosque with space for 107,000 worshippers. In August, Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly presided over the reinauguration of Ben Ezra synagogue in Old Cairo, the country\u2019s oldest synagogue. Leaders of Cairo\u2019s Jewish community later protested that organizers did not invite any Jews to the ceremony and that authorities reinaugurated the building without obtaining the community\u2019s advance consent. In September, the government inaugurated a newly restored Ottoman-era mosque, the city\u2019s earliest Ottoman mosque, within Cairo\u2019s historic citadel. According to Shia community sources and religious freedom experts, Shia Muslims remained unable to establish public places of worship. According to media reports, the Ministry of Education banned students from wearing head coverings that conceal their faces, including the niqab, for the 2023-24 school year.\n\nClashes occurred during the year between Muslim and Coptic communities. In September, the Coptic Orthodox Diocese of Abu Qurqas reported Muslim villagers attacked a Coptic private residence under the mistaken belief that the Coptic community was building an unregistered church. In January, officials of the Monastery of the Virgin Mary in Dranga, Assiut Governorate, restored an icon of the Virgin Mary and Holy Family after unknown persons covered the faces of the depicted figures using black spray paint. In May, following a widely publicized controversy over the portrayal of Cleopatra in a Netflix docudrama by a British actor of African descent, the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) reported comments from journalist Refa\u2019at Rashad, who blamed Jews \u201cwho control the world media and culture\u201d for \u201chistorical distortion\u201d in portraying Cleopatra as \u201cAfrican when she was in fact Macedonian and therefore \u2018light-skinned with Hellenic features.\u2019\u201d In May, social media users reacted angrily to a video in which a pharmacist revealed her veiled friend was prevented from entering a restaurant in the upscale Fifth Settlement District of Cairo. On June 19, a Christian student at Zagazig University received death threats from social media users after he allegedly made Facebook posts denigrating Islam in response to comments insulting Christianity; the student said his account had been hacked and that the offending posts were not his. An October report from the Andalus Center for Tolerance and Antiviolence found significant expansion in \u201cincitement to hatred\u201d and \u201cdisparagement of other faiths\u201d during the previous year. The report noted that hate speech targeting Shias was highest on Facebook, where anti-Shia posts made up over 79 percent of hate speech posts analyzed by the Center, compared X (formerly Twitter), where the highest proportion of religious hate speech, more than 45 percent, targeted Jews.\n\nThe Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires, other embassy officials, and visiting U.S. government representatives regularly raised religious freedom concerns with senior government officials. On May 7, embassy representatives visited Minya Governorate, whose population is approximately 50 percent Christian \u2013 the highest proportion of any governorate \u2013 for meetings with the deputy governor and Coptic bishop of the governorate. In June, the First Lady met with the president of al-Azhar University, Dr. Salama Daoud, and youth who had participated in a U.S. embassy exchange program to discuss shared experiences and values regarding religious freedom. Throughout the year, embassy representatives met with senior officials in the offices of Grand Imam of al-Azhar al-Tayyeb; Dar al-Iftaa; Coptic Pope Tawadros; Greek Orthodox Patriarch Theodoros; bishops and senior clergy of Catholic, Protestant, and Anglican churches; members of the Jewish community, and representatives of unrecognized minorities, including Shia Muslims, Baha\u2019is, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, atheists, and secularists. The inability of students to opt out of Islamic or Christian religious instruction in public schools and government efforts to protect and restore Islamic, Christian, and Jewish religious sites in Cairo and Upper Egypt were among issues discussed. On January 30, the embassy co-organized an observance of International Holocaust Memorial Day. Speakers included a U.S.-based Holocaust survivor and Dr. Nasser Kotb, the nephew of the first Arab recognized by Israel as \u201cRighteous Among the Nations\u201d for his efforts to save Jews in Berlin during World War II. On July 19, the Department of State posted a statement on X that the U.S. government welcomed \u201cEgypt\u2019s pardons of human rights defenders Patrick Zaki and [Zaki\u2019s attorney] Mohamed El-Baqer, both unjustly detained for exercising fundamental freedoms.\u201d",

Throughout the year, police arrested 27 Catholic priests and two Catholic seminarians, detained many other Catholic priests for short periods of time for interrogation purposes, and expelled from the country 18 Nicaraguan and three foreign-national Catholic priests.  In April, President Daniel Ortega called the country\u2019s Catholic Church hierarchy \u201cbishops of Satan.\u201d  In September, during the 54th session of the UN Human Rights Council, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reported his office \u201ccontinued to document violations of freedom of religion and belief, mainly directed against the Roman Catholic Church, including arbitrary detentions.\u201d  In February, a judge sentenced Bishop Rolando Alvarez, without trial, to 26 years in prison and revoked his citizenship for committing treason and cybercrimes.  The same month, the government exiled 222 political prisoners who had been accepted for humanitarian parole into the United States, including six Catholic priests and five others affiliated with the Catholic Church.  After the former political prisoners arrived in the United States, the Managua Court of Appeals declared those individuals \u201ctraitors\u201d and declared the government had stripped them of their citizenship.  In February, an appeals court declared an additional 94 Nicaraguan nationals \u2013 including 10 Catholic priests \u2013 \u201ctraitors\u201d for committing \u201cconspiracy to undermine national integrity\u201d and \u201cspreading false news,\u201d stripping them of their citizenship and ordering the confiscation of their property.  In March, the Holy See closed its nunciature (embassy equivalent) in Managua after the Nicaraguan government \u201csuspended\u201d diplomatic relations in response to Pope Francis comparing the Ortega administration to the Nazi dictatorship of Hitler.  A civil rights lawyer and researcher documented 667 acts of aggression against the Catholic Church and 70 against the evangelical community from April 2018 through August 2023, including arrests, detentions, robberies, desecrations, increased police and parapolice surveillance, and bans on religious processions.  In April, police arrested three worshippers while they tried to hold a traditional Holy Week procession.  The worshippers remained in prison through year\u2019s end.  Reportedly, proregime actors surveilled both Catholic and evangelical services and clergy and tried to intimidate worshippers.  According to media reports, from 2018 through the end of the year, more than 60 evangelical pastors self-exiled due to threats or were forced into exile by authorities.  In August, the government closed the Jesuit-operated Central American University (UCA), alleging it was a center of terrorism.\n\nUsers of social media reported unknown individuals destroyed a Jewish monument in Managua and shared videos of Jewish tombstones desecrated with red swastikas painted on them.  According to reports, the government removed the markings.  Reports of theft from and vandalism of churches continued.  In January, a parish in San Rafael del Sur reported unknown individuals broke into the parish and desecrated communion wafers.  The parish priests called the acts sacrilege.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State and the embassy continued public and private efforts to protect religious freedom in the country and took measures to hold the Ortega-Murillo regime responsible for its silencing of religious leaders, including by placing those who seized the Jesuit-run UCA and played a role in the seizure of its properties on the Section 353 \u201cCorrupt and Undemocratic Actors\u201d list.  Additionally, the Department of State imposed visa restrictions on hundreds of individuals who enabled the regime in its assaults on religious groups and leaders, including Bishop Alvarez.  In October, the Charg\u00e9 raised with the Foreign Minister the U.S. government\u2019s concerns about the marking of swastikas on Jewish tombstones and the desecration of a menorah in Managua.  In September, the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs posted on X (previously known as Twitter), \u201cWe \u2026 condem[n] the actions of the Nicaraguan government that persecute religious freedom, close civic space, and repress the independent voices of the Nicaraguan people.  Fear will never extinguish hope.\u201d  In July, the U.S. Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom posted on X, \u201cWe continue to call for the immediate and unconditional release of all those unjustly detained for peacefully expressing their religious beliefs in Nicaragua.  I urge authorities to allow Bishop Rolando Alvarez, fellow clergy, and lay persons to peacefully pursue their pastoral work.\u201d  The Charg\u00e9 and other U.S. embassy officials met regularly with a range of religious actors to discuss restrictions on religious freedom or belief.\n\nOn December 29, 2023, in accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as amended, the Secretary of State designated Nicaragua a Country of Particular Concern for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom.

The government continued to limit the rights of non-Muslim religious minorities, especially those not recognized under the government\u2019s interpretation of the 1923 Lausanne Treaty, which includes only Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Christians, Jews, and Greek Orthodox Christians. The government continued to categorize Alevi worship as cultural rather than religious and did not recognize Alevi houses of worship, while Alevis continued to state that their faith deserved government recognition as such. Media outlets and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) reported continued entry bans and deportations of noncitizen members of Protestant congregations, and the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) International said authorities \u201ccontinued to undermine religious freedom by deliberately attempting to stifle the spread of Christianity.\u201d Government authorities in Bolu Province, who in January arrested 17 Iranian Christians and held them in removal centers for potential deportation back to Iran, later released them after they reportedly agreed to cease their home-based worship. In July, UN human rights experts called on the government to refrain from deporting 104 Ahmadi Followers of Peace and Light to their countries of origin. UN officials said most members remained in detention at year end. According to the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses 2023 annual report, the government did not provide civilian service alternatives to mandatory military service and did not make legislative amendments in accordance with European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) rulings in favor of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. The report also said Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses could not establish suitable places of worship because of zoning restrictions and building specifications, and group members faced fines for preaching door to door or in public places. In September, there were protests against the government\u2019s enactment of a regulation requiring middle school students to take an additional two hours of Sunni Islam religion classes weekly and the appointment of imams in schools as spiritual counselors. The Greek Orthodox Halki Seminary on Heybeliada Island remained closed. In March, a court overturned a prior court\u2019s ban on the translation of the Quran by Islamic theologian Ihsan Eliacik. There were continued reports of damage to the Hagia Sophia, originally built in the sixth century as a church, which the government reconverted to a mosque in 2020. Jewish citizens said government anti-Israel rhetoric gave impetus to openly antisemitic public protests. On October 18, a Samsun City Council member praised Hitler for killing Jews as he condemned an October 17 explosion at a hospital in Gaza, initially and incorrectly blamed on Israel.\n\nAccording to media, in February, Istanbul police arrested 15 suspects with ties to ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K) for an alleged plot to target synagogues and churches in the city. Media continued to report acts of vandalism of places of worship and cemeteries. Unidentified assailants attacked Islamic theologian and religion education teacher Cemil Kilic in March. Also in March, media outlets reported high school students performed the Nazi salute during a soccer game against a Jewish high school. Antisemitic discourse and hate speech continued in social and print media and increased in reaction to Israel\u2019s action in Gaza following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack. For example, following escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict in October, an opinion piece in Islamic daily Yeni Akit called on the government to revoke the citizenship of Turkish Jews who serve in the Israeli military.\n\nSenior U.S. embassy and consulate officials regularly engaged with government officials throughout the year, including at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Diyanet, and the Directorate General of Foundations (DGF), to discuss religious freedom issues. Embassy and consulate officials met with a wide range of Muslim and religious minority leaders and community representatives, including those of the Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic Orthodox, Jewish, Syriac Orthodox, Protestant, Alevi, Chaldean Catholic, and Baha\u2019i Faith communities. Issues discussed included stresses on shrinking minority populations; lack of legal standing of patriarchates; continued closure of the Eastern Orthodox Halki seminary; social discrimination deriving from geopolitical issues with Israel, Greece, and Armenia; lack of full recognition of Alevis as a religious faith; compulsory religious education; and entrance bans and deportations of Protestant Christians.

Other religious groups must register as associations.\n\nDuring the year, the government again deferred acting on a request of approximately 20 years standing by the Assembly of God to be recognized as a religion.  The government has not recognized any new religious groups since 1985, and the lack of recognition has meant that newborn infants could not be registered as Assembly of God members and its pastors had limited access to hospitals and prisons.  Some Christians and Muslims continued to state that the predominance of Hindus in the civil service favored Hindus in government recruitment and promotion. \n\nIn October, an armed crowd of approximately 30 young Muslim men interrupted a charity concert and forced attendees to disperse.

Although the SRA did not control sermons at every mosque and church, its inspectors continued to be present in every region and were responsible for ensuring that mosque and church sermons were consistent with SRA directives. In June, administrative authorities of the Labe region summoned 12 imams for leading the Eid al-Adha prayer a day later than the official date decreed by the SRA, interrogating them for more than seven hours. The imams were eventually freed following intervention from the Regional Islamic League and pledging to follow instructions from authorities in the future. Local human rights activist Mamadou Kaly Diallo criticized the authorities\u2019 actions in the media, noting that different Islamic groups follow different traditions and previous governments had not intervened in such a way. He called the authorities\u2019 actions a threat to social peace. During a visit to the Kankan region in February, the Minister of Justice and Human Rights defended a local Muslim cleric who conducted prayers in the local vernacular rather than Arabic, a stance that was opposed by senior religious leaders.

A government order for a Pentecostal church\u2019s radio programming to be limited to a 60-kilometer (36-mile) radius remained in effect, although the church continued not to comply and faced no repercussions. In September, President Umaro Sissoco Embalo made remarks at an event in Germany in which he called on religious leaders to work together to address challenges to peace and security. Also in September, the recently elected legislature held an interreligious service attended by Muslim, Catholic, and Protestant leaders in which parliamentarians and religious leaders committed to practicing religious tolerance.\n\nA human rights NGO stated that through early November, 10 individuals died from violence in cases related to witchcraft, and there were 46 cases of violence related to witchcraft during the year. Some religious leaders stated that religious extremism was spreading in the country\u2019s east, citing the country\u2019s porous borders and endemic poverty as principal contributing factors.

In March, a regional court convicted a financial official of the Rural Missionaries of the Philippines (RMP) of terrorist financing.  Cases against others charged in 2022, including four Catholic nuns, remained pending.

The House of Representatives in January overwhelmingly approved the Magna Carta of Religious Freedom Act which specifies the rights of individuals related to religious beliefs as well as punishment of those who contravene such rights.  Humanists, atheists, Muslims, and other religious minorities expressed continuing concern that the bill favored Christians and did not offer equal protections of the right to not believe in any form of religion.  The Senate held a hearing on the legislation in August, and it remained pending at year\u2019s end.  The Commission on Human Rights reported in 2021 that limited budget resources and overcrowding led to problems providing religious accommodation for prison inmates, including providing halal food for Muslims.\n\nIn December, the ISIS-affiliated Dawlah Islamiya terrorist group detonated a bomb during a Catholic Mass at Mindanao State University, killing four persons and injuring more than 50 others.  Social media comments denigrating the beliefs or practices of Muslims continued to appear online during the year, and public figures such as Senator Padilla stated that Muslims continue to face discrimination and human rights abuses in the country.

Surveys conducted in 2022 suggested that Singaporeans viewed religious diversity as a strength and different religious traditions as compatible with the country\u2019s national culture.  Multiple religious groups and interfaith organizations held interfaith events and celebrations in which senior religious leaders and government officials frequently participated.  Religious groups and civil society organizations continued to promote interfaith understanding through events, training, and communications.  Amid the increasing tensions in the Middle East following the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel and Israel\u2019s response, Singapore Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir and Chief Rabbi Mordechai Abergel exchanged public letters, reiterating the importance of unity and citing Singapore\u2019s religious harmony as an example of peaceful coexistence between different ethnic and religious groups. \n\nThe Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officers promoted the importance of respect for religious diversity and religious freedom throughout the year.\nA senior embassy official attended an iftar hosted by the Malay-Muslim community, during which he discussed the importance of religious freedom and strong interfaith relations with Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean and Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary.

The government continued to mandate a civic and moral education course based on Islam for all students in public schools as well as in private schools run by non-Muslim religious organizations. The government-sponsored Institute of Peace, established in 2022, held events aimed at fostering a moderate interpretation of Islam and partnered with an Egyptian university on a program to increase the capacity of local imams to make a closer connection of religious precepts with daily life.\n\nNorms and customs discouraged conversion from Islam.

In meetings with the Minister of Religious Affairs, the Ambassador also discussed the underrepresentation of religious minorities within the MORA. On March 29, the Ambassador hosted an interfaith iftar, during which she highlighted the importance of laws protecting religious freedom, consistent with international protocols. The event marked the first time leaders from minority religious groups joined in breaking the Ramadan fast. During visits to places of worship and meetings with religious leaders, embassy officials emphasized U.S. support for freedom of religion and belief.
