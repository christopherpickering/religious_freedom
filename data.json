        "summary": "The constitution provides for freedom of religion as well as the right to change one\u2019s religion.\u00a0 It specifies there is no state religion and stipulates equality and freedom for all religious communities.\u00a0 The law prohibits religious discrimination and hate speech.\u00a0 On January 26, amendments to the law on religious freedom took effect, eliminating requirements that existing religious groups register to acquire legal status and that religious groups provide proof of ownership of certain religious property to retain title to it.\u00a0 The Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC) had strongly opposed these requirements.\u00a0 Police clashed with individuals protesting the September 5 enthronement of SOC Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral Joanikije in Cetinje, resulting in what press reports described as minor injuries to approximately 50 persons, including protesters and police.\u00a0 The SOC said the protesters, who had the support of President Milo Djukanovic and key members of the government\u2019s political opposition, attempted to undermine its religious rights.\u00a0 Religious groups continued to dispute government ownership of some religious properties and the transfer of cemetery ownership to municipalities or other entities.\u00a0 The government again took no steps to resolve SOC and Montenegrin Orthodox Church (MOC) disputes over ownership of 750 Orthodox sites held by the SOC.\u00a0 After a public outcry, a teacher in Bar declined a government offer to become an acting principal at a school that had fired the teacher in 2020 for inviting her students to participate in a prayer service at an SOC church.\u00a0 At a conference on the Western Balkans in July in Slovakia, President Djukanovic stated that he recalled the 1990s, when \u201cthe Serbian Orthodox Church arrived before the army,\u201d and that \u201c[t]hey followed the same path \u2013 first the Church, then the army and, in the end, they were responsible, among other things, for the genocide in Srebrenica.\u201d\u00a0 The SOC said the Ministry of Interior approved visas for clergy newly arrived in the country but did not address existing cases of clergy denied residence permits by the previous government.\n\nAhead of local elections in the city of Niksic in February, unidentified individuals defaced the Hadzi-Ismail Mosque with graffiti saying \u201cSrebrenica,\u201d \u201cTurks,\u201d and \u201cNiksic will be Srebrenica,\u201d a reference to the 1995 genocide of thousands of Muslims at Srebrenica.\u00a0 The government, NGOs, and other religious groups condemned the vandalism, but there were no arrests.\u00a0 During the year, there were incidents of vandalism of an SOC theological school and a monastery, both in Cetinje, as well as reports of hate speech against Muslims and evangelical Christians.\u00a0 In November, local news site Berane Online published an article criticizing the distribution of evangelical Christian literature and Bibles in the northeastern town of Berane. \u00a0The news site quoted extensively a local SOC priest who condemned the evangelical literature and said the group\u2019s members were \u201cdemons who are nothing but wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d\u00a0 Private individuals posted critical comments or disparaging material on social media about both the SOC and the MOC, for example, calling the SOC war criminals or the MOC a construct of the state.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador and other embassy officials discussed the government\u2019s implementation of the amended law on religion and general treatment of religious groups under it, details of instances of religious discrimination, rising religious tensions following the protests at the SOC Metropolitan\u2019s enthronement, property restitution issues, and relations between religious groups and the government.\u00a0 They also advocated religious tolerance with the President and other government officials, including officials in the Prime Minister\u2019s cabinet, the Ministry of Justice, Human, and Minority Rights (MJHMR), and mayoral and municipal offices throughout the country.\u00a0 The Ambassador and other embassy officials also met with representatives of all principal religious groups.\u00a0 After the defacement of the Niksic mosque in February, embassy representatives met with members of the Islamic Community of Montenegro (ICM), and the Ambassador met with the head of the ICM to express her concern and support.\u00a0 In April, the Ambassador met with senior representatives of the Jewish community to discuss their relations with the government, as well as the Jewish community\u2019s views on antisemitism.\u00a0 In May, the Ambassador hosted an interfaith iftar at her residence, where she and other embassy officials discussed with leaders of the Muslim, Roman Catholic, Jewish, MOC, and SOC communities their general concerns, thoughts on the amended religion law, and ways for the embassy to promote religious freedom and tolerance. \u00a0In November, the Ambassador hosted an interfaith Hanukkah celebration, where she and other embassy officials discussed increasing societal fragmentation and the need for greater interreligious cooperation with leaders of the Jewish, Muslim, MOC, and SOC communities.\n\n",

representing these religions are permitted to register with the government and officially permitted to hold worship services, although other groups reported meeting unofficially.\u00a0 CCP members and members of the armed forces are required to be atheists and are forbidden from engaging in religious practices.\u00a0 National law prohibits organizations or individuals from interfering with the state educational system for minors younger than the age of 18, effectively barring them from participating in most religious activities or receiving religious education.\u00a0 Some provinces have additional laws precluding minors\u2019 participation in religious activities.\u00a0 The government continued to assert control over religion and to restrict the activities and personal freedom of

State Administration of Religious Affairs (SARA) issued regulations, effective May 1, entitled \u201cAdministrative Measures for Religious Clergy,\u201d requires all clergy to pledge allegiance to the

it was adopted as a draft law by the Council of Ministers on December 15.\u00a0 The request for full adoption and implementation of the law was pending with the transition government at the end of the year.\u00a0 This law would make the process of registering religious associations with the Ministry of Religious Affairs, Worship, and Customs (MARCC) more transparent.\u00a0 On July 1, the transition government also adopted its 2021-25 national action plan for countering and preventing violent extremism and terrorism, which drew on data from religious groups.\n\nUnidentified armed individuals continued to abduct individuals, including religious leaders, of all faiths or beliefs throughout the country.\u00a0 Religious leaders were often targeted for abduction for ransom due to their proximity to armed conflict and the high-profile nature of their work, according to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and experts.\u00a0 On October 9, captors released Colombian nun Sister Gloria Cecilia Argoti, abducted in February 2017 in Karangasso in the Koutiala Region by the al-Qa\u2019ida affiliated terrorist group Jama\u2019at Nasr al Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM).\u00a0 Abbot Leon Dougnon, a Catholic priest from the Bandiagara region, and Pastor Emmanuel Goita from Koutiala were also abducted and subsequently released between June and October.\u00a0 Individuals affiliated with terrorist organizations designated by the U.S. government used violence and launched attacks on civilians, security forces, peacekeepers, and others they perceived as not adhering to their interpretation of Islam.\u00a0 According to a report published in August by the Human Rights and Protection Division (HRPD) of the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) covering the period from April to June, terrorist and other armed groups publicly beat two women and a 16-year-old girl in the village of N\u2019Doukala in the Segou Region because they refused to wear veils. \u00a0The report also mentioned these groups prevented women from performing work outside their homes.\u00a0 Particularly in the center of the country, JNIM continued to attack multiple towns in the Mopti and Segou Regions and to threaten Christian, Muslim, and traditional religious communities.\u00a0 Groups identified by authorities as extremist organizations continued to target and close government schools for their perceived \u201cWestern\u201d curriculum.\u00a0 In the region of Mopti, especially in Koro, groups identified as extremists reportedly entered into verbal \u201cpeace\u201d agreements with local populations, with stipulations that permitted the local population to move freely across the subdistrict of Koro and practice their faith in exchange for not challenging the groups\u2019 territorial claims.\n\nMuslim religious leaders continued to condemn what they termed extremist interpretations of sharia, and non-Muslim religious leaders condemned what they characterized as extremism related to religion.\u00a0 Some Christian missionaries again expressed concern regarding the increased influence in remote areas of organizations they characterized as violent and extremist.\u00a0 Representatives of the Catholic organization Caritas stated such organizations banned alcohol and pork and forced women of all faiths to wear veils in some parts of the region of Mopti.\u00a0 Caritas characterized these developments as signs of the growing influence of Islam in Mopti, which they believed threatened the Christian community. \u00a0Muslim, Protestant, and Catholic leaders jointly called for peace and solidarity among all faiths at celebrations marking Christmas, the New Year, and Eid al-Fitr.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador and embassy officials discussed with religious leaders and human rights organizations the importance and long-held tradition of interfaith dialogue as a tool to bring peace to the country, and they underscored to these leaders their important role in promoting religious tolerance and freedom. \u00a0The embassy supported programs to counter violent extremism related to religion and to promote tolerance, peace, and reconciliation. \u00a0The embassy highlighted the work of Muslim frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in a call with the U.S. Secretary of State and met regularly with government officials charged with religious affairs and with representatives from religious minority associations operating in the country. \u00a0In April, to commemorate the beginning of Ramadan, the Ambassador met with influential imams in Bamako, highlighting the role of religious leaders in confronting religious intolerance and promoting peace, and released a statement on the important role religious leaders play in society.\n\n",

It stipulates there is no official religion and the state is neutral in matters of belief, recognizes the equality and independence of religious groups, and prohibits discrimination based on religion. The government has agreements with the Sunni Albanian Muslim Community (AMC), Bektashi Muslim community, Catholic Church, Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (AOC), and Evangelical Brotherhood of Albania (VUSH), an evangelical Protestant umbrella organization. These agreements recognize these groups as the country\u2019s main faith communities and address property restitution and other arrangements. By law, the government gives financial support to four of these faith communities, but not to VUSH or other religious groups; VUSH continued to seek changes to the law that would allow it to receive financial support from the government. The government legalized 62 buildings owned by religious groups during the year that had been built without construction permits, compared with 92 in 2020; 25 additional properties remained under review. The five religious communities with agreements with the government continued to express concerns about restitution of property seized under the former communist regime, stating that corruption, government lack of knowledge of competencies and jurisdiction on property cases, and large caseloads in the court system hampered their claims. The State Agency of the Cadaster (SAC), the official register established in 2020 to show quantity, value, and ownership of real estate, reported challenges in returning property being used by other parties, providing physical compensation by means of other property, or paying cash compensation. VUSH leaders reported continued difficulties in acquiring permission to construct places of worship. The Bektashi community and the AMC again reported problems defending their titles to certain properties. The five main religious communities continued to ask the government to exempt them from paying certain state taxes, per the bilateral agreements between these communities and the government. Although they said they supported the government\u2019s COVID-19 prevention measures, religious leaders complained the government had not responded to their requests for financial assistance to cope with the impact of the pandemic, and that restrictions on public gatherings, which also applied to secular venues, hindered their fundraising ability. In September, the government and the Albanian American Development Fund opened the bidding process for building a museum in Vlora dedicated to the country\u2019s efforts to protect Jews during World War II.\n\nIn April, a man attacked worshippers at a mosque in Tirana, wounding five. Prosecutors asked that the attacker, a convert to Islam, be hospitalized due to a history of mental illness. According to an International Republican Institute (IRI) report, most media in the country referencing Jews focused on Holocaust remembrance and the country\u2019s good relations with Israel, although there were some stories propagating conspiracy theories about Jews. The Interfaith Council, a forum for leaders from the five religious communities with agreements with the government to discuss shared concerns, held several online and in-person meetings domestically and internationally on faith-related and other issues.\n\nThe U.S. embassy urged government officials to accelerate its handling of property claims and to return religious groups\u2019 buildings and other property confiscated during the communist era. Embassy officials met with representatives of religious communities to discuss interfaith and governmental relations, the challenges they faced regarding property legalization and restitution, and financial challenges caused by COVID-19 restrictions. Embassy-sponsored programs, including youth programs, focused on developing community inclusivity, promoting women\u2019s empowerment in religious communities, and emphasizing the compatibility of religious faith and democracy.",

minority religious communities.\u00a0 Religious leaders also expressed concern that the regime might misconstrue religious assembly as part of prodemocracy activities.\n\nAccording to local media, some armed ethnic organizations operating in the country continued to pose a threat to ethnic and religious minority groups, including the Arakan Army (AA), which continued to force local villagers, including Christian religious leaders, to work without pay and recruited villagers to attend military training camp.\u00a0 In September, gunmen shot and killed Rohingya Muslim activist and community leader Mohib Ullah in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh.\u00a0 According to press reports, Ullah\u2019s killers were likely associated with the insurgent group Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA).\u00a0 Ullah had spoken out against ARSA militancy and abuses in the refugee camps in Bangladesh.\n\nIn July, the NUG announced its appointment of a Rohingya activist as an advisor to its \u201cMinistry of Human Rights.\u201d \u00a0Members of ethnic minorities said they continued to face discrimination based on their ethnicity and religion.\u00a0 Rohingya continued to be perceived as foreigners, irrespective of their citizenship status, and as members of a religion commonly viewed with fear and disdain.\u00a0 There were continued reports of social stigma surrounding any assistance to or sympathy for Rohingya.\u00a0 Some civil society leaders said that even among otherwise tolerant individuals, anti-Rohingya sentiment remained prevalent.\u00a0 Some local media reports, however, said the Bamar ethnic majority\u2019s empathy for the decades of persecution suffered by Rohingya and other minorities had grown due to their own post-coup experiences. \u00a0A June public opinion poll found that when asked about relations among persons of different faiths in the country, 47 percent of respondents said that strict protection of one\u2019s own religion would provide a stronger foundation for democracy in the future, while 48 percent said that granting more rights to religious minorities would provide a stronger foundation for democracy in the future.\n\nSenior U.S. government officials \u2013 including the Secretary of State, the Permanent Representative to the United Nations, the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Ambassador, and senior Department of State officials for East Asia and for human rights \u2013 consistently raised ongoing U.S. government concerns about religious freedom with the regime and other internal political actors, as well as with international organizations and also engaged in advocacy on social media calling for an inclusive democracy that respects all ethnicities and religions.\u00a0 Concerns raised included the plight of Rohingya in Rakhine State, hardships facing minority religious communities in Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Shan, and Chin States amid escalating post-coup violence.\u00a0 The U.S. government pressed for full accountability for perpetrators of human rights violations, including those concerning religious freedom. \u00a0The embassy amplified the Department of State spokesperson\u2019s message on the fourth anniversary of the military\u2019s August 25, 2017, ethnic cleansing in Rakhine State.[1]\u00a0 U.S. government officials continued to call for sustainable solutions to address the root causes of discrimination and religiously motivated violence.\u00a0 While embassy facilities in Yangon and Mandalay suspended most of their public programs following the coup, the embassy continued to prioritize ethnic and religious diversity in its exchange programs, selecting participants from Shan, Wa, Kachin, Kayah, Chin, Rakhine, and Mon ethnic groups, many of whom belong to religious minority groups.\u00a0 Embassy representatives, including the Ambassador, continued to engage with Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and Hindu leaders, including ethnic minority religious leaders, members of faculties of theology, and other religiously affiliated organizations and NGOs, to advocate for religious freedom and tolerance.\n\nSince 1999, Burma has been designated a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom.\u00a0 On November 15, 2021, the Secretary of State redesignated Burma as a CPC and identified the following sanction that accompanied the designation:\u00a0 the existing ongoing arms embargo referenced in 22 CFR 126.1(a) pursuant to section 402(c) (5) of the Act.\n\n",

vandalism, although the data collected by agencies often differed because of varied reporting, collection, and analysis methods.\u00a0 The editor-in-chief of a prominent daily issued a statement in April in which he apologized for publishing a caricature depicting a Jewish political pollster and entrepreneur as a puppet master.\u00a0 An unknown assailant vandalized a kosher restaurant in Amsterdam in February, the eighth incident targeting the restaurant since 2018.\u00a0 The Netherlands Institute for Human Rights (NIHR), an independent government advisory body, received 22 complaints of religious discrimination in 2020 (the most recent information available), mostly in the workplace, compared with 26 in 2019.\u00a0 Police registered 517 antisemitic incidents in 2020 (the most recent information available) compared to 768 in the previous year.\u00a0 Of those incidents, 17 involved vandalism (swastikas or antisemitic texts sprayed on property and Jewish monuments) and 27 involved some form of violence. \u00a0Some observers attributed the decrease in complaints to the COVID-19 pandemic-related reduction in the number of public gatherings, for example sports events, where antisemitic incidents tended to occur. \u00a0Antisemitic chanting continued at soccer matches, despite agreements between authorities, the Royal Netherlands Soccer Association (KNVB), soccer clubs, and the Anne Frank Foundation to discourage antisemitic behavior at those events.\u00a0 The Jewish community again stated it was concerned about increasing antisemitism.\u00a0 In September, the Brussels-based NGO Action and Protection League issued the results of its European antisemitism survey, which found that 2 percent of 1,000 respondents ages 18-75 in the Netherlands said they had negative feelings towards Jews.\u00a0 In 2020, police registered 180 incidents of other forms of religious discrimination, most of which targeted Muslims, compared with 225 incidents in 2019.\u00a0 Municipal antidiscrimination boards registered more overall incidents in 2020 (391) than in 2019 (297), 79 percent of which involved anti-Muslim discrimination.\u00a0 Monitoring organizations said there was a further increase in anti-Muslim hate speech online and that many instances of workplace discrimination against Muslims were directed at women wearing headscarves.\u00a0 Muslim women wearing niqabs or burqas reported they were subjected to increased physical and verbal abuse in locations where the full-face covering ban did not apply, such as parks and shops.\n\nThe U.S. embassy in The Hague and the consulate general in Amsterdam emphasized the importance of supporting all faiths and engaging in interfaith dialogue in both formal meetings and informal conversations with government officials from multiple ministries and with parliamentarians.\u00a0 Embassy and consulate general representatives discussed religious freedom issues with leaders of several different faith

although some criminal laws and practices established by the previous government led by Omar al-Bashir remained in effect, including those dealing with blasphemy.\u00a0 Those criminal laws and practices were based on that government\u2019s interpretation of a sharia system of jurisprudence, which human rights groups stated did not provide protections for some religious minorities, including

to Muslim religious leaders, the CLTG discontinued the practice of security forces monitoring imams\u2019 sermons.\u00a0 Members of minority religious groups continued to express concerns regarding the education system, which lacked sufficient teachers equipped to teach courses on Christianity and textbooks that promoted religious diversity.\u00a0 On January 7, Prime Minister Hamdok, following criticism from Muslim clerics, instructed the National Center for Curricula and Educational Research in Khartoum to stop work on developing new school curricula, and established a committee that included religious leaders to review the education program.\n\nMedia reported a Sudanese Church of Christ (SCOC) church located in Jabarona near Khartoum that was attacked four times between December

convicted defendants confessed to membership in Ansaroul Islam, a U.S. government-designated terrorist organization, and said he joined the group to \u201cdefend the Muslim religion.\u201d\u00a0 In October, senior government officials indicated the government was monitoring preaching that could promote violence or intolerance on social media using the National Observatory for Religious

their campaign of violence and sometimes targeted places of worship or religious leaders.\u00a0 Domestic and transnational terrorist groups conducted more attacks and inflicted more violence against civilians than in the previous year, including numerous targeted killings based on religious identity, according to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). \u00a0Attackers killed or kidnapped imams, other clergy, and worshippers, while attacking and destroying mosques and churches.\u00a0 Although responsibility for many attacks in the country went unclaimed, observers attributed most to known terrorist groups Ansaroul Islam, Islamic State in Greater Sahara (ISIS-GS), Jamaat Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), all three designated by the U.S. government as terrorist organizations.\u00a0

security forces. \u00a0On July 21, violent extremists killed a man in front of the mosque of Boudieri. \u00a0In all these attacks the victims were believed to be Muslim.\u00a0 Media and international NGOs reported on violent enforcement by organizations characterized as extremist of the insurgents\u2019 interpretation of Islamic law in the region, with the threat of violence for noncompliance.\u00a0 For example, attackers forced members of communities in the northern part of the country to dress in specific \u201cIslamic\u201d garb, but observers noted this was also occurring across other areas of the country. \u00a0Terrorists attacked and destroyed schools and killed teachers for teaching a secular curriculum and for teaching in French rather than Arabic, according to media reports. \u00a0As of November 30, approximately 3,000 schools had been closed, depriving nearly 500,000 students of the ability to attend school.\n\nHuman rights organizations and religious groups continued to express concern that religiously targeted violence had harmed what they termed the traditional peaceful coexistence of religious groups in the country.\u00a0 Academic and other observers stated that there exists stigmatization of the mostly Muslim ethnic-Fulani community because of the community\u2019s perceived sympathy for those Islamists who are seen as militant, violent, and who recruited ethnic-Fulani to join related armed groups. \u00a0This perception and activity aggravated existing societal tensions and posed a threat to stability.\u00a0 Members of the Burkinabe Muslim Community Organization, the Catholic Archdiocese of Ouagadougou, and the Federation of Evangelical Churches continued to state that despite an increase in religiously motivated attacks, religious tolerance remained widespread as a common value, and numerous examples existed of families of mixed faiths and religious leaders attending each other\u2019s holidays and celebrations.\u00a0 Members of the largest religious communities promoted interfaith dialogue and tolerance through public institutions such as FAIB, which conducted awareness campaigns throughout the country.\n\nU.S.

must be based on \u201cIslamic criteria\u201d and an official interpretation of sharia.\u00a0 The constitution states citizens shall enjoy human, political, economic, and other rights, \u201cin conformity with Islamic criteria.\u201d\u00a0 The penal code provides for hudud punishments (those mandated by sharia), including amputation, flogging, and stoning, and specifies the death sentence for proselytizing and attempts by non-Muslims to convert Muslims, as well as for moharebeh (\u201cenmity against God\u201d) and sabb al-nabi (\u201cinsulting the Prophet or Islam\u201d).\u00a0 According to the penal code, the application of the death penalty varies depending on the religion of both the perpetrator and the victim.\u00a0 In January, parliament amended the penal code to criminalize insulting \u201cdivine religions or Islamic schools of thought\u201d and committing \u201cany deviant educational or proselytizing activity that contradicts or interferes with the sacred law of Islam.\u201d \u00a0Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) said these new provisions put religious minorities at a higher risk of persecution.\u00a0 The law prohibits Muslim citizens from changing or renouncing their religious beliefs.\u00a0 The constitution also stipulates that five non-Ja\u2019afari Islamic schools shall be \u201caccorded full respect\u201d and official status in matters of religious education and certain personal affairs.\u00a0 The constitution states Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians, excluding converts from Islam, are the only recognized religious minorities permitted to worship and form religious societies \u201cwithin the limits of the law.\u201d\u00a0 According to numerous international human rights NGOs and media reporting, the government convicted and executed dissidents, political reformers, and peaceful protesters on charges of \u201cenmity against God\u201d and anti-Islamic propaganda and, in the case of members of some religious minorities, detained them and held them incommunicado.\u00a0 Amnesty International reported an \u201calarming rise\u201d in the execution of ethnic minority prisoners since mid-December 2020.\u00a0 Authorities denied prisoners access to attorneys and convicted them based on \u201cconfessions\u201d extracted under torture. \u00a0In January, authorities executed Baluchi Javid Dehghan (also known as Dehghan-Khold) in Zahedan Central Prison on charges of \u201cenmity against God,\u201d \u201carmed rebellion against the Islamic Republic,\u201d and alleged membership in banned Sunni separatist groups. \u00a0The NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) reported that as of October, government executions continued at an \u201calarmingly high\u201d rate, with at least 226 people put to death, 125 of them under \u201cretributive\u201d (eye-for-an-eye) justice.\u00a0 According to the database of the NGO United for Iran, Iran Prison Atlas, least 67 members of minority religious groups remained imprisoned at year\u2019s end for being \u201creligious minority practitioners.\u201d \u00a0Of the prisoners listed in the database, the government sentenced at least 62 to long-term imprisonment or executed them on charges of \u201cenmity against God\u201d or \u201carmed rebellion against Islamic rule\u201d (baghi), which officials sometimes used in recent years instead of \u201cenmity against God.\u201d \u00a0Human rights NGOs reported poor prison conditions and mistreatment of religious minority prisoners, including beatings, sexual abuse, degradation specifically targeting their religious beliefs, and denial of medical treatment. \u00a0The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran, a U.S.-based human rights NGO, said that from January 1 to September 24, the government sentenced at least 77 individuals to flogging, based on its interpretation of sharia, and carried out these sentences in at least eight cases.\u00a0 NGOs reported that in January, authorities transferred women\u2019s rights activist Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, originally charged in 2014 with \u201cinsulting Islamic sanctities\u201d and \u201cspreading propaganda\u201d for criticizing the government\u2019s policy of stoning women to death for adultery, to Amol Prison in Mazandara Province, far away from her family.\u00a0 According to IranWire and the London-based NGO Article 18, which focuses on religious freedom in Iran, in September, security forces in Shiraz and Mazandaran Province conducted multiple arrests of Baha\u2019is in their homes or workplaces in the last week of September without providing reasons or charges. \u00a0In a July report, UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Iran (UNSR) Javaid Rehman stated there continued to be reports of forced evictions of members of the Sunni Baluch minority in Sistan and Baluchistan Province, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \u00a0An August report by the UN Secretary General highlighted that the Supreme Court upheld the death sentences for 10 Kurdish political prisoners on charges involving \u201cacting against national security,\u201d \u201cspreading corruption on earth,\u201d and \u201cmembership in Salafi groups.\u201d \u00a0According to an October report by the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO), at least 10 Baluchi individuals were summoned to court following a rally in the village of Ramin to prevent the destruction of the Eidgah (land reserved for Eid prayers for Sunni followers). \u00a0Officials continued to disproportionately arrest, detain, harass, and surveil non-Armenian Christians, particularly evangelicals and other converts from Islam, according to Christian NGOs.\u00a0 On March 9, the Tehran Appeals Court reduced Saba Kord-Afshari\u2019s prison sentence, which she received in 2019 on a set of charges relating to protesting the compulsory hijab, from 24 years to seven years and six months in prison. \u00a0UNSR Rehman\u2019s July report and NGOs said authorities continued to confiscate Baha\u2019i properties as part of an ongoing state-led campaign of economic persecution against Baha\u2019is.\u00a0 Authorities issued an order in April denying Baha\u2019is permission to bury their dead in empty plots at the Tehran-area cemetery designated for Baha\u2019is, forcing them to bury them at a mass grave site.\u00a0 Sunni Muslims stated the government did not permit them to build prayer facilities sufficient to accommodate their numbers, and government restrictions forced many Christian converts and members of unrecognized religious minority groups, such as Baha\u2019is and Yarsanis, to assemble in private homes to practice their faith in secret.\u00a0 Authorities reportedly continued to deny the Baha\u2019i, Sabean-Mandaean, and Yarsani religious communities, as well as members of other unrecognized religious minority groups, access to education and government employment unless they declared themselves as belonging to one of the country\u2019s recognized religions on their application forms.\u00a0 The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reported textbooks at all grade levels and across many subjects contained antisemitic material. \u00a0Government officials continued to disseminate anti-Baha\u2019i and antisemitic messages using traditional and social media.\u00a0 On December 16, the UN General Assembly approved a resolution expressing concern about \u201congoing severe limitations and increasing restrictions on the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief\u201d and \u201charassment, intimidation, persecution, arbitrary arrests and detention, and incitement to hatred\u201d against recognized and unrecognized religious minorities.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, non-Shia Muslims and those affiliated with a religion other than Islam, especially members of the Baha\u2019i community, continued to face societal discrimination and harassment, while employers experienced social pressures not to hire Baha\u2019is or to dismiss them from their private-sector jobs.\u00a0 Yarsanis reported experiencing widespread discrimination.\u00a0 They stated Yarsani children were socially ostracized in school and in shared community facilities.\u00a0 Yarsani men, recognizable by their distinct mustaches, continued to face employment discrimination.\u00a0 According to reports, Shia preachers continued to encourage social discrimination against Yarsanis.\u00a0 According to human rights NGOs, converts from Islam to Christianity faced ongoing societal pressure and rejection by family or community members.\u00a0 Shia clerics and prayer leaders reportedly continued to denounce Sufism and the activities of Sufis in both sermons and public statements.\u00a0 Sunni students reported professors continued to routinely insult Sunni religious figures in class.\u00a0 Baha\u2019is reported continued destruction and vandalism of their cemeteries.\u00a0 According to the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), on September 8, a Baha\u2019i cemetery in Dena County, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province was partly destroyed by unknown individuals using heavy machinery.\n\nThe United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran.\u00a0 During the year, the U.S. government used public statements, sanctions, and diplomatic initiatives in international forums to condemn and promote accountability for the government\u2019s abuses against and restrictions on worship by members of religious minorities.\u00a0 Senior U.S. government officials publicly reiterated calls for the release of prisoners held on religious grounds. \u00a0On March 9, the United States sanctioned Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) interrogators Ali Hemmatian and Masoud Safdari for their involvement in gross violations of human rights in Evin Prison, including torturing activists advocating for religious freedom.\u00a0 On December 7, the United States sanctioned the Special Units of Iran\u2019s Law Enforcement Forces (LEF) and Iran\u2019s Counter-Terror Special Forces (NOPO) for violently suppressing protests in November 2019. \u00a0It sanctioned two LEF commanders, Hassan Karami and Seyed Mousavi Azami, as well a Basij commander, Gholamreza Soleimani, and the Governor of Qods City, Leila Vaseghi, for their roles in carrying out crackdowns against peaceful protesters. \u00a0Two prisons, Zahedan Central Prison and Isfahan Central Prison, as well as the warden of Qarchak Women\u2019s Prison, Soghra Khodadadi, and IRGC commander and brigadier general Mohammad Karami were also sanctioned for their roles in the \u201cflagrant denial\u201d of the rights of prisoners and other citizens, including religious minorities.\u00a0 The Treasury Department statement announcing the sanctions said, \u201cZahedan Prison holds several political prisoners who belong to the Baluch ethnic minority group. \u00a0According to public reports, on January 3, 2021, Baluch prisoner Hassan Dehvari was executed in Zahedan Prison. \u00a0Dehvari was sentenced to death for \u2018armed rebellion against the Islamic Rule.\u2019 \u00a0His prison sentence was escalated to execution after he engaged in several acts of peaceful protests, such as signing statements condemning executions of Sunni prisoners and condemning the mistreatment of fellow prisoners.\u201d\n\nSince 1999, Iran has been designated as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom.\u00a0 On November 15, 2021, the Secretary of State redesignated Iran as a CPC.\u00a0 The following sanction accompanied the designation:\u00a0 the existing ongoing travel restrictions based on in section 221(c) of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (TRA) for individuals identified under Section 221(a)(1)(C) of the TRA in connection with the commission of serious human rights abuses, pursuant to section 402(c)(5) of the Act.\n\n",

quasi-governmental Muslim clerical body, used rhetoric considered intolerant by religious minorities, including Shia and Ahmadi Muslims.\u00a0 Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) reported there were multiple reports of assaults on Shia Muslims at Shia events.\u00a0 In September, a mob of more than a hundred persons attacked an Ahmadi mosque in Sintang Regency (an administrative subdivision of a

worship, access for foreign religious organizations, convictions for blasphemy and defamation of religion, the importance of tolerance and rule of law, and the application of sharia to non-Muslims.\u00a0 In December, the Ambassador delivered remarks on religious freedom and tolerance at an event hosted by MUI to launch a human rights school for Muslim clerics.\u00a0 In February, the Charge d\u2019Affaires delivered remarks highlighting religious freedom and tolerance at the 43rd anniversary of the National Istiqlal Mosque, an event that included participation from the Vice

reported several instances of security forces banning Christians from meeting in hotels or private homes.\u00a0 Christian citizens stated the government did not fully recognize their rights, particularly as they pertain to the establishment of a legal entity or association that would grant them the ability to establish an Arabic-language church or a cemetery.\u00a0 The Attalaki

prior to President Kais Saied\u2019s suspension of Parliament on July 25.\u00a0 Jewish groups said they continued to worship freely, and the government continued to provide security for synagogues and

Muslims also remained barred from representation on the National Commission for Minorities within the Ministry of Religious Affairs.\u00a0 The Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial governments passed a series of laws targeting Ahmadi Muslim beliefs.\u00a0 The Ahmadiyya community reported that police registered 49 cases against Ahmadi Muslims under these laws during the year. \u00a0Throughout the year, some government officials and politicians around the country engaged in anti-Ahmadi rhetoric and attended events that Ahmadi Muslims said incited violence against members of their community. \u00a0NGOs expressed concern that authorities often failed to intervene in instances of societal violence against religious minorities due to fear of retaliation, inadequate staff, or apathy. \u00a0NGOs reported perpetrators of societal violence and abuses against religious minorities often faced no legal consequences due to a lack of follow-through by law enforcement, bribes offered by the accused, and pressure on victims to drop cases. \u00a0The government took some measures to protect religious minorities, including establishing a special police unit in all provinces to protect religious minorities and their places of worship. \u00a0Police and security forces enhanced security measures during religious holidays in consultation with religious leaders.\n\nThroughout the year, unidentified individuals and mobs targeted and killed Christians, Hindus, Ahmadi Muslims, Sunni Muslims, and Shia Muslims in attacks believed to be motivated by religion or accusations of blasphemy. \u00a0On December 3, several hundred Muslim workers from a factory in Sialkot, Punjab, attacked Priantha Kumara, a Sri Lankan Christian manager of the factory, for allegedly committing blasphemy by removing far-right extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) political party posters that included Islamic prayers.\u00a0 Attackers beat, kicked, and stoned him to death and set his corpse on fire, according to media reports.\u00a0 Prime Minister Imran Khan said the attack was \u201chorrific\u201d and ordered a high-level inquiry.\u00a0 Media reported that authorities arrested more than 100 individuals after the attack. \u00a0On March 25, six Sunni Muslims died and seven were injured in a Shia-majority area when assailants opened fire on a passenger van traveling from Gilgit to Naltar.\u00a0 On February 11, a teenager shot and killed an Ahmadi homeopathic doctor, Abdul Qadir, in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\u00a0 On September 2, unidentified assailants shot and killed Maqsood Ahmad, a dual British-Pakistani citizen and Ahmadi Muslim in Nankana Sahib, Punjab.\u00a0 On August 19, three persons died, and 59 others were injured in a grenade attack on a Shia procession in Bahawalnagar, Punjab.\u00a0 It was the third sectarian attack in the area in two months.\u00a0 Armed sectarian groups, including factions of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K), continued to stage attacks targeting Shia Muslims, including the predominantly Shia ethnic Hazara community.\u00a0 According to the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), the number of sectarian attacks and killings by armed groups increased compared with 2020, reversing the overall decline in terrorist attacks reported in previous years.\u00a0 Human rights activists reported numerous instances of societal violence related to allegations of blasphemy; of efforts by individuals to coerce religious minorities to convert to Islam; and of societal harassment, discrimination, and threats of violence directed at members of religious minority communities. \u00a0Sunni groups held large sectarian rallies in Peshawar and Karachi in September and October, with speakers warning religious minorities, including Shia and Ahmadi Muslims, of dire consequences if anything they said was deemed blasphemous against the Prophet Mohammed\u2019s companions.\u00a0 NGOs expressed concern about what they stated was the increasing frequency of attempts to kidnap, forcibly convert, and forcibly marry young women and girls from religious minority communities, especially Hindus and Christians.\u00a0 The Center for Social Justice recorded 41 cases of forced conversions through October 31. \u00a0There continued to be reports of attacks on Ahmadi, Hindu, and Christian holy places, cemeteries, and religious symbols.\u00a0 The government continued to implement its National Action Plan against terrorism, by countering sectarian hate speech and extremism and by conducting military and law enforcement operations against violent groups. \u00a0According to Ahmadi civil society organizations, however, the government failed to restrict advertisements or speeches inciting anti-Ahmadi violence, as provided for in the National Action Plan.\u00a0 Civil society groups continued to express concerns about the safety of religious minorities.\u00a0 Multiple civil

security forces accused the priest of collaborating with separatists and detained him for four days before releasing him on bail.\u00a0 In multiple instances, government forces in search of separatists in the Northwest and Southwest Regions destroyed church buildings and clerical residences.\u00a0 On at least two occasions, security forces looking for separatists interrupted church services in Bui, Northwest Region and compelled the worshippers to leave.\u00a0 Multiple religious leaders said that their churches were targets in the fighting between security forces and separatists and underscored that the constant fighting discouraged parishioners from attending worship services.\u00a0 In April, the governor of Adamawa Region suspended night prayers at mosques during Ramadan to prevent the spread of COVID-19; some residents said this restricted their freedom of worship.\u00a0 Religious leaders expressed frustration with the government\u2019s continued failure to register new religious groups and said many requests were pending.\n\nThe U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa (ISIS-WA) launched violent attacks against local communities, disrupted church activities, and abducted civilians, including Christian women and girls, whom they often sexually abused and forced into marriage with Muslim men.\u00a0 The media reported that ISIS-WA was strictly applying sharia in the areas of the country around Lake Chad under its control.\u00a0 Suspected Boko Haram terrorists damaged at least one church building in Krawa-Mafa, Far North Region.\u00a0 In February, Muslim Mbororo herders in Nwa, Northwest Region killed 13 members of the mostly Christian settled population and burned three churches and the home of a local pastor reportedly in response to Christian attacks in the area against members of the Mbororo community. \u00a0According to a pastor in the area, the separatist crisis in the Northwest and Southwest Regions had exacerbated tensions, especially as Mbororos regularly allied with the military against separatists.\u00a0 In June, media reported that separatists attacked priests at a Catholic pastoral center in Mamfe, Southwest Region, killing two individuals and wounding at least 11 others.\u00a0 Also, in Mamfe, separatists on two occasions abducted Catholic priests and released them after negotiations.\u00a0 A priest in Mamfe said a perception that the Catholic Church was wealthy made it a major target of some groups who regularly threatened and abducted priests for ransom.\u00a0 In one instance in Mamfe, the abductors said they had taken a priest as a warning to the Catholic Church, which they considered allied with the government and opposed to the independence of the Northwest and Southwest Regions.\u00a0 In October, gunmen abducted the congregational chairperson of a Protestant church in Bamenda; the national Protestant church organization said separatists carried out the abduction.\u00a0 In May, separatists in Kumbo, Northwest Region fired gunshots during a commemorative Catholic worship service. \u00a0Pro-separatist media later reported that the separatists opposed the presence at the event of the Northwest Region governor and viewed his presence as evidence the Church was collaborating with the government.\n\nIn September, tensions escalated between Muslims and Christians in Ngaoundere, Adamawa Region when the leading imam in the area accused authorities at a Catholic high school of attempting to convert Muslim students by compelling them to wear badges bearing a cross on their school uniforms.\u00a0 After government-led mediation, both sides agreed that Muslim students at the school would be exempt from the requirement, but many Muslim parents withdrew their children from the school after the incident.\u00a0 The Catholic Archdiocese of Bamenda reported that unidentified individuals removed sacred items from two churches in Njinikom, Northwest Region during the year.\u00a0 Throughout the year, Muslim and Christian leaders initiated interfaith activities aimed at facilitating interreligious dialogue, promoting peaceful coexistence of different faiths, and seeking a peaceful resolution to the crisis in the Northwest and Southwest Regions where separatists were seeking secession.\u00a0 Muslim and Christian leaders also collaborated with the government and international organizations to encourage their faith communities to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIn March and in October, embassy officials discussed interreligious tensions and terrorist attacks with government officials, including three mayors in the East and Adamawa Regions. \u00a0In May, the embassy hosted a religious freedom roundtable with a diverse group of prominent religious leaders.\u00a0 In other engagements with Muslim and Christian leaders and civil society groups, embassy officials also discussed interreligious dialogue, communal tensions, and the views of Muslim leaders regarding Boko Haram and ISIS-WA attacks in the Far North Region.\u00a0 In discussions with leading figures from the main religious groups, embassy officers stressed the importance of interfaith dialogue and the role of religious leaders in the search for a peaceful solution to the crisis in the Northwest and Southwest Regions.\u00a0 In March, the embassy issued a press release condemning communal violence between Muslim Mbororos and the Christian community in Nwa and called for those responsible to be held accountable.\n\n",

SOC, Roman Catholic, and Muslim, respectively. \u00a0The government again failed to comply with a 2009 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) decision calling on it to open these positions to other

soldier appealed to the Constitutional Court, where the case was pending at year\u2019s end. \u00a0The 2021 European Commission Report on BiH reported continued ethnic segregation and discrimination in the education system. \u00a0Religious groups again reported inadequate investigation and prosecution of religiously motivated crimes.\u00a0 According to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\u2019s (OSCE) Mission to the country, in 2020 (the most recent year for which data were available), courts adjudicated five cases involving religiously motivated incidents from 2020 and earlier.\n\nThe Interreligious Council of BiH (IRC) registered 23 reported acts of vandalism of religious buildings and three incidents against religious officials but said the number of actual incidents was likely much higher. \u00a0In February, an unknown perpetrator fired gunshots at the Aladza Mosque in Foca, a national monument. \u00a0In Livno Canton, several imams were verbally insulted.\u00a0 In May, an unknown individual sprayed graffiti insulting Jesus on the walls of the Saint Anthony Catholic Church in Bihac. \u00a0In August, vandals broke the windows of an Orthodox church near Kupres and overturned the headstone of its founder. \u00a0The Jewish Community reported increased online antisemitic speech. \u00a0The OSCE reported 16 incidents targeting Muslims and 27 targeting Christians (Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist, and Orthodox) in 2020 (the most recent data). \u00a0The incidents, all of which were reported to police, included threats against religious believers and officials, including Catholic Cardinal Vinko Puljic, disturbances of religious ceremonies, and vandalism.\n\nWith MHRR officials, U.S. embassy representatives emphasized the need to promote respect for religious diversity and enforce equal treatment for religious minorities and the importance of concluding the agreement with the Islamic Community and implementing agreements with the SOC and Catholic Church. \u00a0Embassy officials also urged government representatives to make greater efforts on implementation of the law on religious freedom. \u00a0In February, the Ambassador met with the BiH Presidency members, urging them to assist with the adoption of a framework law governing restitution of religious property confiscated under communism.\u00a0 In June, the Ambassador met jointly in Mostar with Bishop of Mostar Duvno Diocese Petar Palic, Mostar Mufti Salem Effendi Dedovic, and Orthodox Bishop Dimitrije, the first time in decades that these officials met together.\u00a0 They discussed interreligious dialogue, postwar recovery, and reconciliation.\u00a0 In November, the Counselor of the Department of State met with the BiH religious leaders from the Islamic Community, the Catholic Church, and the Jewish Community to discuss their perspectives on the political crisis in BiH and encourage them to take a more active role on reconciliation and peacebuilding. \u00a0In regular meetings with religious groups, embassy officials continued to urge the groups to improve interreligious dialogue to help develop a peaceful and stable society.\u00a0

who allegedly told the victim he \u201clooked Jewish.\u201d \u00a0The perpetrator reportedly said he wanted to \u201ckill his first Jew.\u201d\u00a0 Home Secretary Priti Patel described the incident as seriously disturbing. \u00a0Also in December, the Board of Deputies of British Jews criticized the BBC for falsely alleging that victims of a November 29 antisemitic incident in London provoked their attackers with an anti-Muslim slur.\u00a0 The NGO Tell MAMA (Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks), which monitors anti-Muslim activity, stated in its 2020 annual report (the most recent) there were reports of anti-Muslim hate incidents during that year. \u00a0According to a 2020 joint study conducted by Newcastle University, Northumbria University, the Economic and Social Research Council, and Tell MAMA, more than two thirds of 111 participants living within the three police force jurisdictions of Cleveland, Durham, and Northumbria said manifestations of anti-Muslim sentiment or anti-Muslim hatred were either a regular or everyday occurrence, and half of those who reported experiencing anti-Muslim sentiment or anti-Muslim hatred said they did not report the incidents to police.\u00a0 In April, the Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court convicted and sentenced a woman to 18 weeks in prison for Holocaust denial, the first ever case in the country of imprisonment for that charge.\u00a0 In

Representatives of the Jewish community continued to report authorities performed autopsies on deceased members of the community for deaths that were not suspicious, a practice they said violated Jewish religious beliefs and practice.\u00a0 They stated that despite their continuing efforts to raise the issue with government authorities during the year, it remained unresolved. \u00a0Two of the functioning mosques under the guardianship of the Ministry of Interior (MOI) continued to lack bathroom and ablution facilities.\u00a0 The Department of Antiquities continued to limit regular access to the Hala Sultan Tekke Mosque to only two of the five daily prayers, although it routinely granted expanded access during Ramadan and at the request of the imam.\u00a0 The imam said the Department of Antiquities replaced the security guards after his complaint in 2020 that they allowed some non-Muslim tourists to enter the mosque without observing the dress code. \u00a0Authorities continued to deny permission to perform animal slaughter for food production according to Jewish law.\u00a0 Authorities did not respond to a request pending since 2017 from the Chief Rabbinate of Cyprus to have the right to officiate marriage, death, and divorce certificates.\n\nIn March, unknown persons sprayed anti-Turkish graffiti, Greek flags, and crosses on the exterior wall of the Episkopi Mosque in Limassol District.\u00a0 The Orthodox Church of Cyprus called for the withdrawal of the country\u2019s entry into the annual Eurovision contest, a song entitled \u201cEl Diablo,\u201d charging the song made an international mockery of the country\u2019s moral foundations by advocating \u201cour surrender to the devil and promoting his worship.\u201d\u00a0 Some religious minority groups continued to report societal pressure to engage in public Greek Orthodox religious ceremonies, such as weddings and christenings.\u00a0 Greek Orthodox Christians reported they sometimes faced ostracism from their community if they converted to another religion.\u00a0 Leaders of the main religious groups continued to meet under the framework of the Religious Track of the Cyprus Peace Process (RTCYPP) and advocated for greater religious freedom for faith communities across the island.

Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization in 2014, in September designated four members of al-Islah, a Muslim Brotherhood affiliate, as terrorists.\u00a0 Despite changes to federal laws removing penalties for adultery or consensual extramarital sex, in August the Supreme Federal Court rejected the appeal of a woman from Sharjah convicted of consensual extramarital sex, finding that local prohibitions were still applicable, even in the absence of any federal penalty.\u00a0 In May, the public prosecutor\u2019s office released a video on social media highlighting the penalties for acts

recognition.\u00a0 Dubai authorities eased COVID-19 restrictions gradually during the year.\u00a0 Prayer halls were open to Muslim men throughout the year and authorities reopened prayer halls for Muslim women in June. \u00a0Authorities permitted all houses of worship to return to 50 percent capacity in August.\u00a0 Limits on capacity, however, remained stricter on places of worship than on businesses and entertainment venues.\u00a0 According to leaders of some communities, restrictions on the number of attendees per religious service put undue burdens on non-Muslim faiths due to the limited number of houses of worship non-Muslim communities were permitted.\u00a0 COVID-19 related restrictions disproportionately impacted unlicensed religious organizations that normally congregated in cinemas and hotels but could no longer do so because of social distancing regulations and closures.\u00a0 Federal regulations designed to reduce COVID-19 transmission continued to prohibit

with Friday afternoon, Saturday, and Sunday serving as the new weekend, after previously following the Islamic workweek, which uses Friday and Saturday as its weekend.\u00a0 Abu Dhabi police directed private security personnel at several camps for laborers to surveil gatherings of laborers and report if they discussed security, social, or religious issues.\u00a0 The General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (Awqaf) continued to provide weekly guidance for the content of sermons in Sunni mosques with the stated purpose of limiting the spread of what the authorities characterized as extremist ideology.\u00a0 Some Shia imams chose to follow Awqaf-approved guidance, while the Dubai-based Jaafari Affairs Council, charged with management of Shia affairs, issued additional

country\u2019s first, purpose-built synagogue as part of the larger government-sponsored Abrahamic Family House, scheduled to open in 2022 and bring together a mosque, church, and synagogue to represent the three Abrahamic faiths on one site.\u00a0 Except in the judiciary and military, non-Muslim minorities did not serve in senior federal positions, while among Muslims, Sunnis predominated in these positions, reflecting the country\u2019s religious demographics.\n\nAccording to non-Muslim religious community representatives, there was a high degree of societal tolerance for minority religious beliefs and traditions, particularly for those associated with houses of worship officially recognized by the federal or local emirate governments, although conversion from Islam was strongly discouraged.\u00a0 Conversion to Islam was encouraged, however. \u00a0Dubai\u2019s Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Islamic Culture reported 3,800 Dubai residents converted to Islam during the year, compared with 3,184 in 2020.\u00a0 In some cases, organizations reported that hotels, citing government regulatory barriers, were unwilling to rent space for non-Islamic religious purposes, such as weekly church services.\u00a0 Local media reported minority groups, including registered religious organizations, encountered difficulties obtaining bank loans to cover construction costs for new religious spaces.\u00a0 In February, Jewish communities in the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia announced the formation of the region\u2019s first communal organization, the Association of Gulf Jewish Communities (AGJC), and incorporated it in Dubai.\u00a0 In June, a memorial exhibition on the Holocaust, which its organizers said was the first of its kind in the Arab world, opened in Dubai.\u00a0 On April 8, Holocaust Remembrance Day (HaShoah), the Washington Institute for Near East Policy hosted a virtual forum about teaching the Holocaust in the Arab

police arrested Narasinghanand a few weeks later, although he was subsequently released on bail. \u00a0The others had not been arrested by year\u2019s end.\u00a0 The Pew Research study on \u201cReligion in India\u201d released in July noted that most Indians valued religious tolerance but preferred living religiously segregated lives. \u00a0Eighty-nine percent of Muslims and Christians surveyed said they were \u201cvery free to practice their own religion\u201d but 65 percent of Hindus and Muslims said they believed communal violence between religious groups was \u201ca problem\u201d for the country. \u00a0Freedom House downgraded the country\u2019s ranking from \u201cfree\u201d to \u201cpartly free\u201d during the year in part due to policies described as advancing Hindu nationalist objectives.\n\nDuring the year, U.S. embassy officials, including the Charg\u00e9s d\u2019Affaires, engaged with members of parliament, politicians from multiple political parties, religious leaders, representatives of faith-based organizations, and civil society members to discuss the importance of religious freedom and the responsibility of democracies to ensure the rights of religious minorities.\u00a0 During engagements with political parties, civil society representatives, religious freedom activists, and leaders of various faith communities, U.S. government officials discussed the importance of religious freedom and pluralism; the value of interfaith dialogue, and the operating environment for faith-based NGOs.\u00a0 Throughout the year, the Charg\u00e9s d\u2019Affaires met with religious communities, including representatives of the Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh faiths to discuss their perspectives and views on religious freedom issues.\u00a0 In May, the embassy organized a virtual interfaith dialogue during Ramadan to emphasize the U.S. government\u2019s commitment to religious freedom and interfaith harmony.\u00a0 In July, the Secretary of State, during his visit to the country, addressed the importance of freedom of religion and belief in his opening remarks and held a roundtable with diverse faith leaders to discuss inclusive development.\n\n",

against Israeli actions in Sheikh Jarrah, the Damascus Gate, and the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount in Jerusalem.\u00a0 On April 13, on the evening of the first day of Ramadan, media and officials from the Jordanian Waqf in Jerusalem, which administers the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, reported that the Israeli National Police entered the site and disconnected loudspeakers used for the call to prayer after the Waqf\u2019s call to prayer disrupted an official Memorial Day service for fallen soldiers attended by Israeli President Reuven Rivlin in the adjacent Western Wall Plaza.\u00a0 During the last Friday of Ramadan on May 7 and again on May 10, Israeli police entered the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount using teargas, stun grenades, and rubber tipped bullets to disperse Palestinians they said were throwing rocks.\u00a0 While the government stated it was rare for any individual to be barred entry to the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, human rights and civil society organizations said Israeli authorities periodically banned individual Palestinian residents of the occupied territories, and Arab/Palestinian and Jewish citizens of Israel from the site. \u00a0The government reiterated that non-Islamic prayer was not allowed on the grounds of the site, but non-Muslim visitors were allowed. \u00a0Some religious minority groups said the police were not interested in investigating attacks on members of their communities.\u00a0 The Chief Rabbinate continued not to recognize as Jewish some citizens who self-identified as Jewish, including Reform and Conservative converts to Judaism and others who could not prove Jewish matrilineage to the satisfaction of the Chief Rabbinate.\u00a0 As a result, the government prohibited those individuals from accessing official Jewish marriage, divorce, and burial services in the country.\u00a0 Some Jewish individuals and groups performed religious acts such as prayers and prostration on the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount despite the longstanding historical norms against overt non-Islamic prayer there.\u00a0 On July 8, the Supreme Court, by a vote of 10-to-one, rejected 15 petitions challenging the Basic Law of Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People (Nation State law).\u00a0 The government maintained its policy of not accepting new applications for official recognition from religious groups but stated that members of unrecognized religious groups remained free to practice their religion.\u00a0 Members of some religious minorities said that the government did not provide the same service and benefits to them as to the country\u2019s majority Jewish population.\n\nDuring a one-week period in May, amid tensions in Jerusalem and violence in Gaza, ethnic-based violence and civil unrest broke out in a number of mixed Jewish-Arab cities in the country, leading to multiple deaths and injuries.\u00a0 The violence during the unrest included gunfire, stone throwing by protesters (both Jewish and Arab/Palestinian citizens), arson attacks on synagogues, desecration of Muslim gravestones, and vandalism of automobiles. \u00a0The Israel National Police (INP) made approximately 1,550 arrests during and after the unrest with the overwhelming majority of the arrestees being Arab/Palestinian citizens.\u00a0 On May 12 in the mixed Jewish-Arab town of Lod, Jews shot and killed Moussa Hassouna in clashes between residents.\u00a0 Later on May 12, Arab/Palestinian citizens in Lod stoned the car of Jewish resident Yigal Yehoshua who died on May 17 after being hit in the head with a thrown

Mohammed Mahamid Kiwan died after he was shot on May 18 at the Mei Ami junction on Route 65.\u00a0 His family said police were responsible.\u00a0 In April, during the period leading up to the unrest, Palestinian youths in Jerusalem physically attacked ultra-Orthodox individuals and posted videos of the attacks on the social media app TikTok. \u00a0On July 1, police arrested Palestinian Jerusalemites for defiling graves in the Har Hamenuchot Cemetery while filming themselves on TikTok.\u00a0 Jewish individuals and groups continued to engage in nationalist violent hate crimes against Palestinians and their property in the West Bank and Arab/Palestinians in the country, (which the attackers called \u201cprice tag\u201d attacks to exact a \u201cprice\u201d for actions taken by the

September, the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Hiddush reported that 65 percent of respondents identified as either secular (48 percent) or traditional not religious (17 percent), the same result as in the 2020 poll.\n\nIn meetings with Israeli government officials, the Ambassador, Charge d\u2019Affaires, and other U.S. embassy officials stressed the importance of religious pluralism and respect for all religious groups.\u00a0 Numerous high-level U.S. officials made formal stops at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust remembrance site, to keep a public spotlight on antisemitism and highlight religious tolerance.\u00a0 Senior U.S. officials spoke publicly about the importance of maintaining the historic status quo at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount and conveyed this message in meetings with government officials.\u00a0 Throughout the year, embassy officials used social media platforms to express U.S. support for tolerance and the importance of openness to members of other religious groups.\u00a0 Embassy-supported initiatives focused on interreligious dialogue and community development and advocated a shared society for Arab and Jewish populations.\u00a0 The embassy also promoted the reduction of tensions between religious communities and an increase in interreligious communication and partnerships by bringing together representatives of many faith communities to advance shared goals and exchange knowledge and experience, and through engagements aimed at greater integration of the Arab minority into the broader national economy, especially the high-tech

on a provision of law requiring religious groups to register also with local councils. \u00a0This was despite a finding by the UN Human Rights Committee in 2019 that the requirement violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the constitution, and a Supreme Court ruling in 2016 that the requirement was unconstitutional. \u00a0In a July 14 publication, the UN

societal-wide restrictions on assembly, including for all faith groups, to limit the transmission of COVID-19.\u00a0 Some religious communities said provincial orders and additional measures were discriminatory against religious groups because mass gatherings for sports events and other functions were permitted. \u00a0There were multiple reports across the country of clergy opposing or refusing to adhere to COVID-19 restrictions on the grounds that the restrictions infringed on religious freedom. \u00a0In October, a Manitoba judge ruled provincial restrictions to limit the spread of COVID-19 were reasonable and did not violate constitutional rights to worship and to assemble for religious practice and dismissed a class-action lawsuit filed by seven churches in Manitoba in June, according to press reports.\u00a0 In the suit, the plaintiffs stated that public health orders that restricted in-person church services to 10 persons or 25 percent of capacity infringed on their religious freedom and caused a \u201ccrisis of conscience.\u201d \u00a0The Quebec government filed an appeal in June of an April legal ruling that allowed limited exemptions to a 2019 provincial law prohibiting certain provincial government employees from wearing religious symbols while exercising their official functions.\u00a0 The ruling exempted English-language schools in the majority

2019, and 2018 combined. \u00a0The increase occurred at the same time protests were taking place across the country in response to the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\u00a0 The group also stated that incidents of antisemitism tended to increase during federal or provincial election campaigns.\u00a0 The B\u2019nai B\u2019rith Canada League for Human Rights recorded 2,610 reports of antisemitic incidents in 2020, compared with 2,207 in 2019. \u00a0According to press reports, in June, a man driving a truck in London, Ontario struck five members of a Muslim family, killing four of them.\u00a0 Police said the driver targeted the family because they were Muslim and charged the driver with four counts of first degree murder, one count of attempted murder, and one count of terrorism.\u00a0 The trial remained pending at year\u2019s end.\u00a0 \u00a0In June, an unidentified man attacked two Muslim women in Alberta, grabbing one of the women by her hijab, pushing her to the ground, and knocking her unconscious, according to media reports. \u00a0In January, police charged a man with threatening to set fire to a place of worship and possession of incendiary materials after he painted swastikas on Congregation Shaar Hashomayim, one of Montreal\u2019s largest synagogues, and brought a canister of gasoline to the site. \u00a0In July, unidentified individuals vandalized 11 churches, some Catholic and some Protestant, in Calgary, Alberta with red and orange paint.\u00a0 In June and July, unidentified individuals set fire to several Roman Catholic churches in indigenous communities across the country after the discovery of unmarked graves believed to be of indigenous children on or near sites of former Indian residential schools. \u00a0Catholic and Protestant religious groups operated most of the schools and, according to media, the government funded them to force the assimilation of indigenous children into the dominant Canadian culture and strip them of their native

those laws enacted under the former government of Afghanistan that were in effect prior to their takeover remained in effect unless the laws violated sharia.\u00a0 Taliban leaders issued decrees specifying acceptable behaviors under their interpretation of sharia, but variously described them as \u201cguidelines\u201d or \u201crecommendations\u201d and unevenly enforced them. \u00a0Press reports following the Taliban takeover raised fears the group would consider Christian converts as apostates.\u00a0 These reports, combined with statements from some Taliban leaders starting in August reserving the right to enforce harsh punishments for violations of the group\u2019s strict interpretation of sharia, drove some Christian converts into deeper hiding, according to International Christian Concern, an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) that focuses on persecution of Christian communities.\u00a0 At year\u2019s end, there were no reports of Taliban representatives having directed sharia-related punishments.\u00a0 According to Amnesty International, Taliban fighters killed 13 Shia Hazaras in Daykundi Province on August 31; the Taliban denied the allegations.\u00a0 In November and December, the Taliban detained 28 members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community in Kabul.\u00a0 According to members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, the Taliban falsely accused them of belonging to ISIS-Khorasan (an affiliate of ISIS and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization, also known as ISIS-K).\u00a0 The Taliban held 18 of them through year\u2019s end.\u00a0 The NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW)reported the Taliban expelled Shia Hazara members from their homes in several provinces in October, in part to redistribute land to Taliban supporters.\u00a0 In August, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said in an interview with National Public Radio (NPR) that the group would respect the rights of members of religious minority groups, including Shia Hazaras.\u00a0 On November 16, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told the press, \u201cWe are providing a safe and secure environment for everyone, especially the Hazaras.\u201d\u00a0 Both prior to and immediately following the Taliban takeover, predominantly Shia Hazara communities expressed fear the Ashraf Ghani administration and the Taliban lacked the ability to protect them from violence and discrimination.\u00a0 According to Hazara community and NGO representatives, Shia Hazaras continued to face longstanding and widespread discrimination by Ghani government officials in public service delivery, public sector hiring, and other areas before August 15.After the Taliban takeover, Taliban leaders publicly pledged to protect the rights of Sikhs and Hindus, although some Sikhs and Hindus reported they had ceased to congregate at their gurdwaras (places of worship), and others sought to resettle abroad due to fear of violent attacks by the Taliban and ISIS-K.\u00a0 In November and December, high level Taliban representatives held meetings with leaders of Shia, Sikh, and Hindu communities, reportedly to offer protection and improve relations.\u00a0 According to community representatives, in these meetings the Taliban laid out rules for the behavior of women, forbade the playing of music, and presented restrictions on businesses owned by minority religious group members.\u00a0 Some Hazara political figures expressed continued concern over the Taliban\u2019s commitment to support freedom of worship but commented that this engagement represented a shift from the Taliban\u2019s approach between 1996 and 2001.\u00a0 According to civil society groups, at year\u2019s end, approximately 150 members of the Sikh and Hindu communities remained in the country, down from approximately 400 at the start of the year.\u00a0 The Taliban closed the Ministry for Women\u2019s Affairs in September, announcing the reconstituted Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, charged with enforcing the Taliban\u2019s interpretation of sharia, would be housed in the same building.\u00a0 While enforcement varied by province and district, local Taliban representatives enforced decrees on gender segregation, women\u2019s dress and head covering, men\u2019s facial hair, unaccompanied women, and music.\u00a0 On December 3, Taliban \u201cSupreme Leader\u201d Hibatullah Akhunzada issued a decree stating that women should not be considered property and must consent to marriage.\u00a0 Media reported the Taliban framed the decree as a call to adhere to broader Islamic law on women\u2019s rights.\u00a0 Some observers praised the decree; others said it did not go far enough because it did not mention a woman\u2019s right to work or to access education and other public services.\n\nthe UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (ISIS-K claimed responsibility. \u00a0ISIS-K also conducted such attacks against other groups.\u00a0 In total, for the first six months of the year, 20 incidents targeted the Shia Hazara community resulting in 143 killed and 357 injured, compared with 19 attacks attributed to ISIS-K and other anti-government elements in 2020. \u00a0According to UNAMA, during the second half of the year, attacks claimed by or attributed to ISIS-K increased and expanded beyond the movement\u2019s previous areas of focus in Kabul and the eastern part of the country.\u00a0 Between August 19 and December 31, the United Nations recorded 152 attacks by the group in 16 provinces, compared with 20 attacks in five provinces during the same period in 2020. \u00a0In addition to targeting the Taliban, ISIS-K also targeted civilians, in particular Shia minorities, in urban areas.\u00a0 ISIS-K claimed responsibility for suicide attacks on two Shia mosques in Kunduz and Kandahar cities on October 8 and 15.\u00a0 On October 8, an ISIS-K suicide bomber killed 70 to 80 members of the Hazara community at a mosque in Kunduz.\u00a0 On October 15, a suicide bomber attack targeting the largest Shia mosque in Kandahar, the Fatima Mosque (also known as the Imam Bargah Mosque), killed more than 50 worshippers and injured at least 100. \u00a0Two December 10 attacks in western Kabul targeting a predominantly Shia Hazara neighborhood remained unclaimed at year\u2019s end.\u00a0 Prior to the Taliban takeover, antigovernment forces carried out several attacks on religious leaders that resulted in fatalities.\u00a0 According to the Ministry of Haj and Religious Affairs (MOHRA), over the last two decades, the Taliban and other extremist groups had killed 527 religious scholars, including approximately 50 Sunni and Shia religious leaders killed between February 2020 and July 2021. \u00a0Prior to their August takeover and as previous years, the Taliban killed and issued death threats against Sunni clerics for preaching messages contrary to the Taliban\u2019s interpretation of Islam. \u00a0Taliban fighters killed progovernment imams and other religious officials throughout the country, and the Taliban warned mullahs not to perform funeral prayers for Ghani administration security officials.\u00a0 On May 8, unidentified individuals detonated a car bomb in front of the Sayed ul-Shuhada school in a predominantly Shia Hazara community, killing at least 85 civilians and injuring another 216.\u00a0 No group claimed responsibility for the attack. \u00a0According to press interviews in October, Shia Hazaras struggled to take what some characterized as a \u201clife or death\u201d risk to go to mosque on Fridays.\n\nSikhs, Hindus, Christians, and other non-Sunni Muslim minority groups continued to report that some Sunni Muslims verbally harassed them, although Hindus and Sikhs stated they still were able to practice their respective religions in public prior to August 15.\u00a0 According to international sources, Baha\u2019is and Christians continued to live in constant fear of exposure and were reluctant to reveal their religious identities to anyone.\u00a0 Christian groups reported public sentiment, as expressed in social media and elsewhere, remained hostile towards converts and to Christian proselytization.\u00a0 They said individuals who converted to or were studying Christianity reported receiving threats, including death threats, from family members.\u00a0 Christians and Ahmadiyya Muslims reported they continued to worship only privately and in small groups, at home or in nondescript places of worship, to avoid discrimination and persecution.\u00a0 Prior to the Taliban takeover in August, observers said local Muslim religious leaders continued their efforts to limit social activities, such as concerts, which they considered inconsistent with Islamic doctrine.\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Kabul suspended operations on August 31. \u00a0In October and November, the U.S. government condemned ISIS-K attacks on Shia mosques and engaged Taliban leadership to press for the protection of religious minorities from repression and violence.\u00a0 On November 29-30, a U.S. government delegation met with senior Taliban representatives in Qatar.\u00a0 The U.S. delegation expressed \u201cdeep concern regarding allegations of human rights abuses and urged the Taliban to protect the rights of all Afghans, uphold and enforce its policy of general amnesty, and take additional steps to form an inclusive and representative government.\u201d\u00a0 After August 31, the U.S. government also conveyed this message consistently in meetings with the so-called Taliban Political Commission in Doha, Qatar, through the Afghanistan Affairs Unit.\u00a0 efore the Taliban takeover in mid-August, U.S. embassy officials worked with the government to promote understanding of religious freedom and the need for the acceptance and protection of religious minorities.\u00a0 To enhance the Ghani administration\u2019s capacity to counter violent religious extremism and foster religious tolerance, embassy representatives met with the Office of the National Security Council (ONSC) and MOHRA, among other government agencies.\u00a0 The embassy regularly raised concerns about public safety and freedom to worship with security ministers.\u00a0 Until the Taliban takeover, embassy officials continued to meet regularly with leaders of major religious groups, as well as religious minorities, scholars, and NGOs, to discuss ways to enhance religious tolerance and interreligious dialogue. \u00a0While working with the Ghani administration, the embassy sponsored programs for religious leaders to increase interreligious dialogue, identify ways to counter violent religious extremism, empower female religious leaders, and promote tolerance for religious diversity.\n\n",

although civil courts have preeminence over all other courts.\u00a0 Sentences may be appealed from sharia and customary courts to civil courts.\u00a0 In addition to civil courts, sharia courts function in 12 northern states and the Federal Capital Territory, and customary courts in most of the 36 states.\u00a0 Religiously affiliated state schools must admit students of all faiths or no faith; Christian-owned state schools must allow students to wear the hijab, while Muslim-owned state schools require all female students to wear it. \u00a0Civil society organizations and media stated that general insecurity again increased and was prevalent throughout the country, particularly in the North West region.\u00a0 There were kidnapping and armed robbery rings in the South as well as the North West, criminal groups in the South South, and criminal groups and separatists in the South East, but there was a significant reduction in the number of violent incidents and deaths in the North East linked to the terrorist insurgency there. \u00a0There were numerous violent incidents between predominantly Muslim herders and mostly Christian, but also Muslim, farmers in the North Central and South West regions and between predominantly Muslim herders and mostly Muslim, but also Christian, farmers in the North West.\u00a0 According to the Council on Foreign Relations, there were an estimated 1,112 deaths during the year from violence among ethnic groups, herdsmen, and farmers.\u00a0 The government continued security operations and launched operations that authorities stated were meant to stem the insecurity and violence throughout the country.\u00a0 Some observers, such as the nongovernmental organization (NGO) International Crisis Group (ICG), said the government\u2019s efforts were inadequate.\u00a0 The Kaduna State Court released Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, head of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), a Shia political organization, and his wife in July.\u00a0 On several occasions, security forces clashed with IMN marchers, resulting in reports of casualties, including at least one death on each side, which both sides disputed.\u00a0 After detaining him for more than a year, the Kano State government in June charged Mubarak Bala, President of the Humanist Association of Nigeria, with deliberately \u201cposting blasphemous statement(s)\u2026insulting the Holy Prophet of Islam\u201d and Muslims in Kano State calculated to \u201ccause a breach of public peace,\u201d among other charges.\u00a0 In January, the Kano State High Court vacated a sharia court\u2019s conviction and death sentence of Yahaya Sharif-Aminu for blasphemy and remanded the case to the sharia court for retrial.\u00a0 The same high court acquitted a man convicted of blasphemy as a minor by the same sharia court and vacated his 10-year prison sentence.\u00a0 Kano State authorities banned Muslim cleric Sheikh Abduljabbar Nasiru-Kabara from preaching and charged him with blasphemy for comments he made during a television debate.\n\nTerrorist groups, including Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa (ISIS-WA), attacked population centers and religious targets, including churches and mosques, and maintained an ability to stage forces in rural areas and launch attacks against civilian and military targets across the North East, according to observers.\u00a0 ISIS-WA increased its use of improvised explosive devices, which resulted in dozens of military deaths.\u00a0 Observers also reported that ISIS-WA expanded efforts to implement shadow governance structures in large swaths of the region.\n\nAccording to NGOs such as ICG, the level of insecurity and violence increased, including in the predominantly Muslim North West, where expanded numbers of criminal groups carried out thousands of killings, kidnappings, and armed robberies. \u00a0Because issues of religion, ethnicity, land and resource competition, and criminality are often closely linked, it was difficult to categorize many incidents as being solely, or even principally, based on religious identity. \u00a0According to information on its website, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), an NGO, reported 3,699 civilian deaths from the violence during the year, compared with 2,455 in 2020.\u00a0 According to a survey conducted by NGO Mercy Corps, a minority of the violence in the north of the country was interreligious, and both Christians and Muslims were perpetrators and victims.\u00a0 The NGO stated that \u201crather than religious belief or animus, we find that intercommunal violence is largely driven by insecurity and a lack of trust between ethno-religious groups competing for political power and control over natural resources.\u201d\u00a0 The report also stated that \u201cfor a minority of northern residents \u2026 religious freedom remains a concern,\u201d if indirectly, because fear of attacks created a fear of gathering in religious communities and \u201cexacerbates tensions and mistrust between religious groups \u2013 the primary pathway to intercommunal conflict in the north.\u201d\u00a0 There were instances of mob violence against clergy and members of religious groups and mass killings of Muslims and Christians that press reports and observers described as planned and carried out by organized groups. \u00a0For example, in May, criminals shot and killed eight Christians and burned down a church and several homes in Kaduna State.\u00a0 In August, Christian youths killed 27 Muslims on a bus in Plateau State.\u00a0 On September 26-27, according to international NGO CSW and subsequent reports by other NGOs and press, Muslim herders killed at least 49 persons and abducted 27, most of whom were Christian, in several attacks on communities in religiously mixed southern Kaduna State. \u00a0In June, the Tiv and Jukun communities, both of which are Christian, clashed over land and water resources, often razing churches.\u00a0 On October 25, gunmen killed at least 18 worshippers and abducted 11 during early morning prayers at a mosque in Mashegu Local Government Area in Niger State.\u00a0 On December 8, at a mosque in the same area, ICG reported an armed group killed between nine and 16 persons and injured 12 others during early morning prayers.\u00a0 CSW reported several cases during the year of Muslim men kidnapping young Christian girls and forcing them into marriage and conversion to Islam.\n\nThe U.S. embassy, consulate general in Lagos, and visiting U.S. government officials \u2013 including the Secretary of State \u2013 raised freedom of religion issues such as the resolution of widely publicized blasphemy cases, the role of religious leaders in peacebuilding and social trust, and reports of societal abuses and discrimination against individuals based on religion during the year.\u00a0 These included meetings with government officials such as President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Presidential Chief of Staff Ibrahim Gambari, cabinet ministers \u2013 including Attorney General Abubakar Malami, Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama, and Minister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola \u2013 and National Assembly members.\u00a0 The Ambassador and other senior embassy officials regularly met with interfaith and religious groups across the country, including the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Society for the Support of Islam, the Islamic Society of Removal of Innovation and Reestablishment of the Sunna (JIBWIS), and the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC).\u00a0 They met with religious leaders in Plateau and Taraba States to discuss and encourage efforts to promote peace and religious tolerance in those states.\u00a0 The embassy continued to fund peacebuilding programs in conflict-prone states such as Kaduna and Plateau, and interfaith dialogue training for leaders in six North West and North Central states.\u00a0 The embassy awarded five small grants to faith-based and community organizations to support reconciliation in communities, primarily in the North Central region, experiencing ethnoreligious violence.\n\nThe Secretary of State determined that Nigeria did not meet the criteria to be designated as a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in or tolerating particularly severe violations of religious freedom or as a Special Watch List country for engaging in or tolerating severe violations of religious freedom under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 when such designations were announced on November 15, 2021. \u00a0Nigeria had previously been designated as a Country of Particular Concern in 2020 and a Special Watch List country in 2019.\n\n",

government burial procedures.\u00a0 On October 26, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed a 13-member Presidential Task Force to implement his \u201cOne Country, One Law\u201d campaign pledge and named General Secretary of the Buddhist nationalist group Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thero, as chairman.\u00a0 Following criticism that the task force and Gnanasara, a Buddhist monk known for anti-Muslim rhetoric, would \u201ceventually turn towards targeting minorities,\u201d the President narrowed the task force\u2019s mandate.\u00a0 In media appearances in September, Gnanasara said the Muslim community was complicit in the Easter Sunday attacks and any future attacks, and also admonished the Catholic Archbishop of Colombo for his criticism of the government on the Easter Sunday investigations.\u00a0 Muslim leaders lodged a complaint with police against Gnanasara for inciting hate speech, and Christian clergy and Buddhist monks warned the public of what they said were planned attempts by Gnanasara to create communal tension in the country.\n\nAccording to civil society groups, highly visible social media campaigns by Buddhist nationalist groups such as BBS targeted and incited violence against religious minorities, in particular the Muslim community.\u00a0 BBS continued to use social media to promote what it called the supremacy of the ethnic Sinhalese Buddhist majority and vilify religious and ethnic minorities.\u00a0 During the year NCEASL documented 77 incidents of attacks on churches, intimidation of and violence against pastors and their congregations, and obstruction of worship services, compared with 50 incidents in 2020.\u00a0 In 11 instances, NCEASL said crowds assaulted or threatened pastors, their family members, and congregants.\n\nU.S. embassy officials repeatedly urged senior government officials and political leaders, including the President and Prime Minister, to defend religious minorities and protect religious freedom for all, emphasizing the importance of religious minorities in the national reconciliation process, and calling for due process for those in prolonged detentions under the PTA, including Muslims detained in connection with the Easter Sunday attacks.\u00a0 The Ambassador affirmed in a public statement in January that the rights and dignity of families of COVID-19 victims
