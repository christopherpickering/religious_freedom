        "summary": "The constitution defines the country as an Islamic republic and specifies Twelver Ja\u2019afari Shia Islam as the official state religion. It states all laws and regulations must be based on \u201cIslamic criteria\u201d and an official interpretation of sharia. The constitution states citizens shall enjoy human, political, economic, and other rights, \u201cin conformity with Islamic criteria.\u201d The penal code provides for hudud punishments (those mandated by sharia), including amputation, flogging, and stoning. It specifies the death penalty for proselytizing and attempts by non-Muslims to convert Muslims as well as for moharebeh (\u201cenmity against God\u201d) and sabb al-nabi (\u201cinsulting the Prophet or Islam\u201d). According to the penal code, the application of the death penalty varies depending on the religion of both the perpetrator and the victim. In 2021, parliament amended the penal code to criminalize insulting \u201cdivine religions or Islamic schools of thought\u201d and committing \u201cany deviant educational or proselytizing activity that contradicts or interferes with the sacred law of Islam.\u201d Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) said these new provisions put religious minorities at a higher risk of persecution. The law prohibits Muslim citizens from changing or renouncing their religious beliefs. The constitution states Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians (excluding converts from Islam) are the only recognized religious minorities permitted to worship and form religious societies \u201cwithin the limits of the law.\u201d\n\nAccording to numerous international human rights NGOs and media reporting, the government convicted and executed dissidents, political reformers, and peaceful protesters on charges of \u201cenmity against God\u201d and spreading anti-Islamic propaganda. Authorities carried out hudud punishments such as amputation of fingers (for theft), flogging, and internal exile. The government denied individuals access to attorneys and obtained false confessions through torture in some cases. It reportedly detained and held members of religious minorities incommunicado. In his July report on human rights in Iran, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran (UNSR) expressed alarm at \u201cthe disproportionate number of executions of members of minority communities, in particular the Baluch and Kurdish minorities,\u201d who together accounted for 35 percent of the 251 individuals executed between January and June. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran (ABC) reported there were 576 executions in 2022, including 71 in December, an increase from 317 executions in 2021 and 248 in 2020. On November 16, Amnesty International reported that authorities were seeking the death penalty for at least 21 persons, many for \u201cenmity against God.\u201d The Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) stated that during the year, the government arrested 140 individuals, imprisoned 39, issued travel bans against 51, summoned 102, raided the homes of 94, and brought 11 to trial for their religious beliefs. Government officials, including the Supreme Leader, routinely engaged in egregious antisemitic rhetoric and Holocaust denial and distortion.\n\nIn September, 22-year-old ethnic Kurd Mahsa Amini, a Sunni, died in the custody of the Gasht-e-Ershad (literally \u201cGuidance Patrol\u201d but more commonly known as \u201cMorality Police\u201d) after being detained for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly and thereby violating the country\u2019s strict Islamic dress code. Her death sparked nationwide protests, particularly in regions home to minority populations, including Amini\u2019s home province of Kurdistan. According to NGOs and media reports, on September 30, security forces killed several dozen Baluch protesters in Zahedan city, Sistan and Baluchistan Province, and injured hundreds more during demonstrations after Friday prayers, sparked by Amini\u2019s death. The demonstrators also demanded accountability for the alleged rape of a 15-year-old girl by a police commander. According to analysis by Human Rights Watch (HRW), police and intelligence agents opened fire on unarmed protestors from rooftops around the open-air Sunni Grand Mosalla prayer complex and the Maki Mosque, the main Sunni mosque in Zahedan and the largest Sunni mosque in the country. At year\u2019s end, the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported that government security forces had killed 512 protestors, including 69 children, and arrested or detained 19,204 individuals since the outbreak of demonstrations in September. On December 8, authorities executed Mohsen Shekari for \u201cenmity against God,\u201d the first reported instance of the death penalty being imposed on an individual tied to the nationwide protests.\n\nAccording to the Baha\u2019i International Community (BIC), Amnesty International, multiple international news organizations, and the United Nations, in July and August, security forces in cities across the country conducted multiple raids of Baha\u2019i homes, confiscated property deemed \u201cillegitimate wealth,\u201d and arrested Baha\u2019is in their homes or workplaces on unsubstantiated charges including \u201ccausing intellectual and ideological insecurity in Muslim society.\u201d In October, the organization Baha\u2019is of the United States stated that more than 1,000 Baha\u2019is were being held within the criminal justice system. In August, a group of UN human rights experts released a joint statement calling on the government to stop the increasing arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances of members of the Baha\u2019i Faith and the destruction or confiscation of their properties in what the experts said \u201cbears all the signs of a policy of systematic persecution.\u201d\n\nOfficials continued to disproportionately arrest, detain, harass, and surveil Christians, particularly evangelicals and other converts from Islam, according to Christian NGOs. Authorities also forcibly disappeared Christian converts, whom it accused of \u201cZionism\u201d and proselytizing. On November 24, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution calling on the government to \u201cuphold all human rights, including the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, peaceful assembly, association and religion or belief.\u201d According to the database of the NGO United for Iran, Iran Prison Atlas, at least 75 individuals remained imprisoned for religious practice. Of the prisoners listed in the database, many were sentenced on charges of \u201cenmity against God,\u201d or \u201cinsulting Islamic sanctities.\u201d Those imprisoned included Baha\u2019is, Christians, including Christian converts, Gonabadi Dervishes, Sunnis, and some Shia. Human rights NGOs reported poor prison conditions and mistreatment of religious minority prisoners, including beatings, degradation specifically targeting their religious beliefs, and denial of medical treatment. In July, according to several NGOs, at least 22 Sunni prisoners in Karaj city went on a hunger strike to protest the refusal of Tehran prosecutor Ali Salehi to address poor prison conditions, to which Salehi responded, \u201cSunni citizens do not even have the right to live in Iran.\u201d\n\nIn August, IranWire reported that the government published a 119-page document, Hijab and Chastity Project, detailing the government\u2019s hijab policy and calling for stronger measures of strict enforcement. Sunni Muslims said the government did not permit them to build prayer facilities sufficient to accommodate their numbers, and government restrictions forced many Christian converts and members of unrecognized religious minority groups, such as Baha\u2019is and Yarsanis, to assemble in private homes to practice their faith in secret. The Jewish community in Tehran warned people via the messaging app Telegram to not visit synagogues during the High Holy Days \u201cdue to the dangerous situation.\u201d\n\nAuthorities reportedly continued to deny members of unrecognized religious minority groups access to education and government employment unless they declared themselves as belonging to one of the country\u2019s recognized religions on their application forms. UN experts reported universities rejected more than 90 Baha\u2019i students between January and August. The NGO Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-se) reported, \u201cThe curriculum remains rife with antisemitic rhetoric\u201d and textbooks also contained anti-Sunni material. Government officials and government-affiliated organizations continued to disseminate anti-Baha\u2019i and antisemitic messages using traditional and social media. On December 15, the UN General Assembly approved a resolution expressing concern regarding \u201congoing severe limitations and increasing restrictions on the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, restrictions on the establishment of places of worship, undue restrictions on burials carried out in accordance with religious tenets, attacks against places of worship and burial, and other human rights violations, including but not limited to the increased harassment, intimidation, persecution, arbitrary arrests and detention of, and incitement to hatred that leads to violence against, persons belonging to recognized and unrecognized religious minorities.\u201d\n\nOn November 7, the Ministry of Intelligence and Security stated it had arrested 26 individuals in connection with an attack on a Shia shrine in Shiraz city, in Fars Province, for which ISIS claimed responsibility. On August 15, Radio Farda reported, \u201cIn a sign of \u2026 rising anger [against the clerical regime], physical attacks against clerics appear to be increasing,\u201d and that, as a result, some religious officials did not wear their robes or turbans in public to avoid being targeted, while others warned about public anger and the decline in the stature and influence of the Shia clergy. The press and NGOs reported several attacks on Shia clerics during the year. According to multiple sources, non-Shia Muslims and those affiliated with a religion other than Islam, especially members of the Baha\u2019i community, continued to face discrimination in employment and other societal discrimination and harassment. Prominent Sunni cleric Molavi Abdolhamid Izmaee lzahi criticized the government in a number of Friday sermons and called on it to release those arrested during antiregime protests, to respect the rights of all religious minorities, and to stop accusing members of the Baha\u2019i Faith of apostasy. According to human rights NGOs, converts from Islam to Christianity faced ongoing societal pressure and rejection by community members. Sunni students reported professors continued to routinely insult Sunni religious figures in class. Baha\u2019is reported continued destruction and vandalism of their cemeteries.\n\nThe United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran. During the year, the U.S. government used public statements, sanctions, and diplomatic initiatives in international forums to condemn and promote accountability for the government\u2019s abuses against and restrictions on worship by members of religious minorities. The President and other senior U.S. government officials expressed support for peaceful protesters in the wake of Mahsa Amini\u2019s death; they used social media to affirm the rights of the country\u2019s religious minorities and condemn officials for antisemitic statements.\n\nSince 1999, Iran has been designated as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom. On November 30, 2022, the Secretary of State redesignated Iran as a CPC. The following sanction was identified in connection with the designation: visa restrictions pursuant to section 221(c) of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (TRA) for certain senior officials of the Government of Iran identified under section 221(a)(1)(C) of the TRA in connection with the commission of serious human rights abuses against citizens of Iran or their family members.",

Observers stated that the bill was intended to strengthen the government\u2019s ability to prosecute antisemitic hate crimes, and it remained pending at year\u2019s end. Religious minority groups maintained that the government\u2019s continued failure to create a legislative framework for formal recognition of religious groups discriminated against groups that did not have conventions with the government. The government argued that it was not in its competence to define the characteristics of a religion and that doing so would be contrary to religious freedom. The government continued to deliberate on a national action plan to combat antisemitism, which it committed in 2020 to adopt. On June 1, the government nominated an interministerial delegate to coordinate policies to combat racism, antisemitism, and LGBTQI+ hatred, including finalizing the action plan to combat antisemitism.\n\nThe nongovernmental organization (NGO) Research and Information on Antisemitism in Luxembourg (RIAL) reported most of the antisemitic incidents that occurred during the year involved violence, although the group did not cite specific examples. RIAL also reported at least 65 antisemitic social media posts. It also reported that during some live protests against COVID-19 measures, protesters wore yellow stars of David and compared themselves to Jews persecuted during the Holocaust.\n\nU.S. embassy representatives discussed religious freedom issues with government officials at the Ministry of State, including government efforts to combat antisemitic and anti-Islamic sentiment and the ministry\u2019s interaction with religious communities. Embassy personnel also met with religious groups to discuss their concerns.",

        "summary": "The constitution stipulates the separation of religion and state and the equality of all religions before the law. It also protects the right of individuals to express their religious beliefs and to practice religious rituals, provided these do not violate public order or public morality. The law prohibits the government from interfering in religious activities; it also states the government and citizens have a responsibility to combat \u201creligious extremism\u201d and \u201cradicalism.\u201d The law specifies the government may dissolve religious organizations if they cause racial, national, religious, or social animosity; proselytize in a way that \u201cdegrades human dignity;\u201d or hinder secular education. In March, amendments to the religious freedom law came into effect that transferred responsibility for appointing and reappointing religious personnel in all mosques from the state-controlled Caucasian Muslim Board (CMB) to the State Committee on Religious Associations of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SCWRA). The government also has authority to approve the appointment of religious figures in non-Islamic religious communities.\n\nLocal human rights groups and others said the government continued to physically abuse, temporarily hold incommunicado, arrest, and imprison religious activists, and that many arrests and convictions of religious figures, including on drug possession charges, were politically motivated. During the year, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) found the government violated individual freedom of religion or belief in two judgments involving seven individuals, including one case involving arrests of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses meeting for prayer in a private home. A human rights nongovernmental organization (NGO) said that as of year\u2019s end, 22 individuals remained imprisoned for their religious beliefs or practices. On September 16, the court extended until March 2023 the pretrial detention of Iranian-trained Shia imam Sardar Babayev, who faced treason charges. Human rights activists said the government\u2019s prosecution was motivated by Babayev\u2019s religious activities.\n\nAuthorities continued to initiate legal action against individuals associated with the unregistered Muslim Unity Movement (MUM), which the government characterized as an extremist group and accused of receiving funding from Iran. MUM members continued to report authorities physically abused them while in custody. One MUM member reported authorities raped him, then held him in administrative detention (detention for a nonviolent offense) for 15 days. Some civil society activists and human rights advocates considered the incarceration of MUM members politically motivated. Officials stated the government was not considering providing alternative service for conscientious objectors, as stipulated in the constitution. Authorities continued to imprison Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses for refusing compulsory military service, despite their willingness to perform alternative service.\n\nAt year\u2019s end, the SCWRA had registered 12 new religious communities, all of which were Muslim. The government described the March amendments to the religious freedom law giving the SCWRA authority to appoint and reappoint religious personnel as necessary to protect against foreign influence and prevent terrorism. Civil society organizations said the changes further impinged on the free exercise of religion and violated the constitutional separation of religion and state. The Norwegian-based international religious freedom NGO Forum 18 reported the SCWRA fired Imam Mirseymur Aliyev for holding end-of-Ramadan (Eid al-Fitr) prayers on May 3 instead of the government-approved date of May 2. The SCWRA said Aliyev voluntarily resigned. NGOs said the government fined Muslims who met in private homes for group prayer without permission.\n\nLocal experts on religious affairs, religious leaders, and civil society representatives said the general public continued to show tolerance of, and in some cases financially supported, minority religious groups they viewed as \u201ctraditional\u201d (i.e., those considered historically present in the country), including Jews, Russian Orthodox, and Catholics. According to the same sources, some individuals viewed religious groups that had less of a historical presence in the country with suspicion and mistrust.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador, Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires (Charg\u00e9), and other U.S. embassy officers engaged government officials to advocate the release of individuals that civil society groups said were imprisoned for their religious beliefs. The Ambassador, the Charg\u00e9, and embassy officers urged government officials to address longstanding problems involving the registration process for smaller religious communities and to implement a civilian alternative to military service for conscientious objectors, as stipulated in the constitution. The Ambassador advocated at the highest levels of government for the protection of religious and cultural sites in the territories returned to Azerbaijani control after the 2020 fighting. The Ambassador and other embassy officers met regularly with representatives of registered and unregistered religious groups and civil society to discuss religious freedom in the country. Embassy officers also had consultations with religious leaders and scholars regarding the March changes to the religious freedom law and its related regulations and how these could affect free exercise of religion.",

In September, the government passed a law amending the 2014 law regulating religious groups, which included expanding government oversight over the registration, operation, and management of religious groups. While some religious groups voiced concerns regarding some of the contents of the new law, other groups expressed support. As of year\u2019s end, however, the law had not been enforced or used as a basis for government action. Police did not enforce bans on nonaccredited religions. In July, police arrested and imprisoned approximately 26 followers of Eusebie Ngendakumana, considered a Catholic prophet by her followers, for holding a prayer session considered illegal by local authorities in Kirundo province. Two pastors from the Unity in the Holy Spirit Church (EUSEBU), a denomination with Pentecostal roots and a countrywide presence, were killed in Bujumbura\u2019s Muha Commune on April 2, reportedly due to a struggle for control of the church, with police arresting 11 other EUSEBU pastors in connection with the killings.\n\nIn January, the National Conference of Churches of Burundi (CNEB) organized a two-day workshop for representatives of different religious groups on the role of religious leaders in the development of the country. A Muslim nongovernmental organization (NGO) reported that young Muslim women were at higher risk of becoming victims of human trafficking.\n\nDuring meetings with government officials, the U.S. Ambassador discussed U.S. government engagement with religious leaders and other religion-related topics, including noting the strong leadership of local religious representatives in strengthening social cohesion and promoting peace.

The law requires religious groups to seek government recognition by meeting legally established criteria and allows the government to close the premises of unregistered groups. There are 85 recognized religious groups and more than 1,100 unrecognized religious groups in the country.\n\nThe government recognized four new Christian religious groups during the year. During the year, the government took actions in connection with the ongoing dispute between pastors over leadership of the Brazilian-origin Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (IURD in Portuguese), which split the church into two groups; one linked to the IURD in Brazil and the other based in Angola. In March, an Angolan court convicted a leader of the of the Brazil-linked group for forcing pastors to undergo vasectomies but suspended his sentence. The court also acquitted him and three other church leaders on money laundering, tax fraud and criminal association charges, stemming from allegations against them in 2020. In April, leaders of the Brazil-linked group announced that their facilities would reopen, pursuant to court order. The National Institute for Religious Affairs (INAR) stated the group\u2019s temples (churches) would not be opened until they were transferred to the Angolan IURD, which was the only one recognized by the government; that did not happen by year\u2019s end. Except for 11 opened in 2021, the IURD temples remained closed during the year.\n\nBefore the August 24 presidential election, Christian religious groups met with political leaders in an ecumenical celebration urging voters to engage in peaceful and free elections. Representatives of the Roman Catholic church were among the official election observers, who were led by Gabriel Mbilingi, Archbishop of Lubango and former head of the Conference of Bishops of Angola and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 (CEAST).\n\nThroughout the year, officials from the U.S. embassy raised religious freedom issues with government officials at the national level, including the closure of places of worship, long-pending registration applications, and the implementation of religious freedom legislation. Embassy officials spoke with representatives of religious groups and civil society organizations throughout the country about the continuing issue of slow recognition of religious groups, the IURD intradenominational split, and the role of churches in the presidential election.

The government continued to assist religious groups to maintain places of worship and to fund some schools operated by religious groups that met national education standards.\n\nThe country\u2019s religious leaders continued to emphasize the high value they and the population placed on tolerance and peaceful coexistence among faith-based communities. In one example, Catholic Church leaders protested to the government after they said an imam denigrated the Catholic faith on television. The imam apologized for his remarks, and the broadcasting network pledged to avoid airing similar remarks in the future. Local and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) continued to focus attention on the abuse of children, including forced child begging, at some daaras. These organizations continued to urge the government to address the problem through more effective regulation and prosecution of offending teachers.\n\nIn December, the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom met with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Office of the Presidency to discuss the country\u2019s role as a founding member of the International Religious Freedom and Belief Alliance and regional leader on peaceful religious pluralism. The Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officers met regularly with senior government officials to discuss conditions faced by students (known locally as talib\u00e9) at daaras, as well as the government\u2019s efforts to combat forced child begging at those schools.

was sometimes difficult to categorize incidents based solely on religious identity due to the close linkage between religion and ethnicity. \u00a0During the year, there were reports of threats, detentions, and violence targeting minority religious and ethnoreligious groups. \u00a0On January 17, media outlets reported a Buddhist monk was among a group of civilians that military forces abducted and forced to serve as a human shield against opposition forces.\u00a0 In March, according to the Chin Human Rights Organization (CHRO), military regime soldiers vandalized, looted, and destroyed Zokhua Baptist Church in Hakha Township, Chin State.\u00a0 In April, approximately 100 military regime soldiers stormed the Sacred Heart Cathedral compound in Mandalay, forcibly entering the church, the archbishop\u2019s house, and other buildings based on unsubstantiated accusations that the church was supplying weapons to opposition forces. \u00a0An International Commission of Jurists report released in October concluded that some of the military\u2019s raids and attacks on places of worship \u201ccould amount to war crimes under international law.\u201d\u00a0 The Office of UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported in October that regime authorities had confined 148,000 predominantly Muslim Rohingya in camps within Rakhine State. \u00a0The regime enforced extensive restrictions on in-country movement of Rohingya.\u00a0 According to a local nongovernmental organization (NGO), the regime detained at least at least 2,240 Rohingya individuals during the year, including women and children.\u00a0 Regime-controlled courts sentenced almost all adults to two years in prison and sent the children to the Nget Aw San youth detention center in Twantae Township, Yangon Region, for breaching travel restrictions. \u00a0According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), as of the end of the year, the military regime had detained a total of 91 Buddhist monks since the coup, including 36 during the year. \u00a0The regime also detained a total of 17 Christian leaders and clerics, including five during the year, and one Muslim religious leader. \u00a0According to the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM), established by the UN Human Rights Council, it collected and analyzed more than three million pieces of evidence of possible human rights violations or abuses in Burma from 2019 to 2022, including reports of approximately 1,300 victims and eyewitnesses in Rakhine, Chin, Shan, Kachin, and Karen States, which all have minority religious populations. \u00a0Religious leaders also expressed concern the regime might misconstrue religious assembly as part of prodemocracy activities. \u00a0In May, media outlets reported that the joint advocacy of the Rakhine and Rohingya Student Unions had resulted in the regime\u2019s lifting the ban on Rohingya students\u2019 attending Sittwe University, although students remained banned from certain courses. \u00a0In October, media outlets in Rakhine State reported the regime had initiated an appeal to a restriction on the use of land previously occupied by Rohingya who fled the 2017 genocide and crimes against humanity in order to officially register ownership of the land to a regime-controlled border guard force.\n\nAccording to local media, some ethnic armed organizations operating in the country continued to pose a threat to ethnic and religious minority groups.\u00a0 In October, local media outlets reported the killing of prominent Rohingya teacher and leader Shafikul Islam in Buthidaung Township, Rakhine State, reportedly by the Arakan Army, whose ranks are composed largely of Rakhine Buddhists, which issued a statement denying responsibility for his death.\u00a0 Another Rohingya leader, Sali Hamuk, was killed a few days later, reportedly by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, whose ranks are composed largely of Rakhine Muslims, which also denied responsibility.\n\nThere were continued reports of social stigma surrounding any assistance to or sympathy for Rohingya.\u00a0 According to Muslim activists, Rohingya continued to be perceived as not truly belonging to the country, irrespective of citizenship status, and as belonging to a religion commonly viewed with fear and disdain.\u00a0 There were continued reports of general anti-Muslim prejudice.\n\nSenior U.S. government officials, including the Secretary of State, the Permanent Representative to the United Nations, the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Ambassador, the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom, and senior Department of State officials for East Asia and for human rights consistently raised ongoing U.S. government concerns regarding religious freedom with the prodemocracy groups, members of the wider opposition movement, as well as with international organizations.\u00a0 They also engaged in advocacy on social media calling for an inclusive democracy that respects all ethnicities and religions.\u00a0 Concerns raised included the plight of predominantly Muslim Rohingya in Rakhine State as well as hardships facing minority religious communities in Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Shan, and Chin States amid escalating post-coup violence.\u00a0 The U.S. government pressed for full accountability for perpetrators of human rights violations, including those concerning religious freedom. \u00a0In March, the Secretary of State determined that members of the Burmese military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Rohingya.\u00a0 On August 24, the United States issued a joint statement with the EU, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK to mark the fifth year since the regime launched its violent attack on Rohingya communities in Rakhine State.\u00a0 U.S. embassy exchange programs continued to prioritize recruitment efforts to increase ethnic and religious diversity.\u00a0 Embassy representatives, including the Ambassador, continued to engage with Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and Hindu leaders, including ethnic minority religious leaders, members of faculties of theology, and other religiously affiliated organizations and NGOs, to advocate for religious freedom and tolerance.\n\nSince 1999, Burma has been designated a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom.\u00a0 On November 30, 2022, the Secretary of State redesignated Burma as a CPC and identified the following sanction that accompanied the designation:\u00a0 the existing ongoing arms embargo referenced in 22 CFR 126.1(a) pursuant to section 402(c) (5) of the act.\n\n",

Proselytizing for any religion except Sunni Islam is illegal, and the law provides for deportation of foreigners who do so. The law prohibits the performance of non-Sunni religious rituals in public places on the basis of \u201caffronting society\u2019s cohesion and endangering national unity.\u201d\n\nThere were no reports of arrests for Comorians engaging in other religious practices, but members of non-Sunni groups reported broad self-censorship and stated they practiced their beliefs only in private. Shia Muslims continued to report limited government surveillance during major religious holidays. For the third consecutive year, there were no reports of national leaders making public statements against religious minorities. Multiple religious minority group leaders said that 2022 had been \u201cquiet and peaceful\u201d and again attributed the government\u2019s relative restraint to engagement from the United States and others on religious freedom issues. Private Shia commemorations of all Eid holidays, Ramadan, and Ashura proceeded peacefully on the three islands. Shia Muslims on Anjouan said that local authorities continued to prevent them from practicing in the Shia mosque that had existed on the island for several years; they were forced to worship in a Shia community center instead.\n\nThere continued to be reports that local communities unofficially shunned individuals who were suspected of converting from Islam to Christianity or from Sunni to Shia Islam.\n\nRepresentatives from the U.S. Embassy in Antananarivo, Madagascar, (which is accredited to Comoros) engaged on issues of religious freedom with government officials, including the president and officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, and Ministry of Justice, focusing on the importance of individuals having the ability to practice their religion freely and of government officials refraining from statements criticizing religious minorities. During the December U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom met with a delegation of senior Comorian government officials to discuss the status of freedom of religion or belief in the country. Embassy representatives also discussed religious freedom with religious and civil society leaders and others, including members of minority religious groups.\n\nOn November 30, 2022, in accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as amended, the Secretary of State again placed Comoros on the Special Watch List for having engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom.",

On June 17, the Brussels Regional Parliament voted against a legislative proposal that would have banned animal slaughtering without stunning. Brussels remained the only one of the country\u2019s three regions where ritual slaughter \u2013 animal slaughter following kosher and halal procedures \u2013 can take place. The Belgian Buddhist Union remained unrecognized as a religious group despite an announcement by the ruling coalition in 2020 of its intent to do so.\n\nSeveral incidents took place involving Jews, including insults, harassment, or physical assaults, mainly in the Antwerp Jewish Quarter. In July, private Jewish patrols reported that two individuals near an Antwerp synagogue shouted antisemitic slogans at Jewish individuals. The situation escalated into violence, with a perpetrator kicking a member of the Jewish community and taking his watch. Police arrested one individual but the second fled the scene.\n\nU.S. embassy officials met regularly with senior government officials in the Office of the Prime Minister; at the Ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Justice; and with members of parliament to discuss anti-Muslim and antisemitic incidents and discrimination. The Ambassador and other embassy officials met with civil society and religious leaders in Brussels and other communities to address anti-Muslim and antisemitic incidents and sentiment and to advocate religious tolerance. In October, the embassy hosted the U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism for four days to discuss religious freedom and antisemitism in the country. The Ambassador published an op-ed calling for appointing a full-time National Coordinator on Antisemitism and encouraged senior government officials to create this position and office. The embassy continued to fund a nongovernmental organization (NGO) project educating high school students from varied backgrounds on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to break down stereotypes and combat antisemitism and anti-Muslim sentiment in the country.",

The constitution guarantees women\u2019s equality with men, \u201cwithout breaching the provisions\u201d of sharia.\n\nIn March, the UN Economic and Social Council\u2019s Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ECOSOC) expressed concern about reports of harassment, intimidation, arrests, and detention of Shia religious figures. In November, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) expressed concerns about reports that authorities restricted the rights of the Shia community to worship and profess their religious beliefs. Reflecting the country\u2019s demographics, the majority of citizen detainees and prisoners were Shia. Human rights groups reported security officials mistreated prisoners. In March, a prominent Shia prisoner accused guards of attempting to assault him. The ombudsman\u2019s office and the government-affiliated National Institution for Human Rights (NIHR) said no physical abuse occurred. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), media, and opposition outlets reported that the government continued to summon Shia rights activists for questioning. NGOs and human rights activists continued to state Shia prisoners received inadequate medical treatment. The government reportedly investigated 12 individuals for unspecified \u201ccrimes affecting religion,\u201d charged nine with publicly violating Ramadan restrictions, and imprisoned three for insulting religious symbols. In June, the Ministry of Social Development (MOSD) allowed the Islamic Enlightenment Shia Society, the charity wing of the banned al-Wifaq opposition Shia political party, to reopen; the government had ordered it shut down in 2016.\n\nThe government continued to regulate the content of religious sermons of both Sunni and Shia religious leaders. Shia sources said that unlike in prior years, the government did not summon Shia clerics for questioning related to their sermons. According to procession organizers, the government permitted large groups to gather in Manama and in Shia-majority villages to observe Ashura \u2013 among the most significant days of the Shia religious calendar. Some Shia prisoners reported that during Ashura, prison authorities gave them additional time and resources to practice Ashura rituals in common areas, in contrast to previous years, but a media source said this was not true for all prisoners. Some prisoners stated authorities punished them for observing other Shia holidays. The ombudsman\u2019s office reported that based on its prison visits, it found Shia prisoners received adequate religious accommodation. In July, authorities prohibited individuals from gathering to sing a song praising a ninth-century Shia cleric; authorities said the song was Iranian propaganda and summoned and fined individuals who disobeyed. During the year, the government funded the construction and renovation of several Sunni and Shia mosques in multiple parts of the country. Shia sources expressed dissatisfaction that Shia doctrine was not included in Islamic studies in public schools, which they said focused on Sunni Islam. According to Shia leaders and community activists, the government continued to discriminate against Shia citizens and to give Sunni citizens preferential treatment for Ministry of Education (MOE) scholarships and positions in the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and military, and government policy effectively gave preference to Sunni applicants for citizenship.\n\nIn June, the King appointed a new cabinet of 22 ministers that included nine professed Shia. One critic said Shia representation should be \u201cat least\u201d half to reflect the country\u2019s religious demographics. In July, the government issued the National Human Rights Plan for 2022-2026, which it developed in consultation with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, setting forth government goals for advancing religious freedom and freedom of expression, among other priorities. On April 18, the King met with senior Shia cleric Sayed Abdulla al-Ghuraifi, and they discussed the value of religious discourse, according to reports. Social media commentators described the visit as a trust-building exercise between the government and the Shia community. In November, Pope Francis, the Grand Imam of al-Azhar, and other religious leaders from around the world participated in a conference in Manama on East-West peaceful coexistence, and Pope Francis conducted an open-air Mass attended by 30,000 persons. According to non-Muslim religious groups, there was a high degree of government support for their worship activities.\n\nAnti-Shia and anti-Sunni commentary appeared in social media. NGOs reported on the adverse economic effect of Sunni-Shia tensions and local political divisions. Shia human rights and political activists reported persistently higher unemployment rates, limited prospects for upward social mobility, and lower socioeconomic status for that community compared with the Sunni population. According to minority religious groups, there was a high degree of tolerance within society for minority religious beliefs and traditions, although not for conversion from Islam or for atheistic or secularist views. Non-Muslim religious community leaders again reported converts from Islam were unwilling to speak publicly or privately to family or associates about their conversions for fear of harassment or discrimination. In September, there was a brief upsurge in antisemitic rhetoric online following an erroneous report that the government intended to establish a Jewish neighborhood in Manama.\n\nU.S. government officials, the Ambassador, and other U.S. embassy representatives met with senior government officials, including the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and the Minister of Justice, Islamic Affairs, and Endowments, and national human rights monitoring institutions to urge respect for freedom of religion or belief and expression, including the right of religious leaders to speak and write freely, and to advocate the full and equal participation of all citizens, irrespective of religious or political affiliation, in political and social activities and economic opportunities. The Ambassador and other embassy officials met regularly with religious leaders and community members from a broad spectrum of faiths, representatives of NGOs, and political groups to discuss freedom of religion and freedom of expression as they related to religious practice.

Following Maye\u2019s arrest and detention, authorities interrogated other Pentecostal church officials, who subsequently condemned Maye\u2019s actions in statements that they said were intended to preserve their ability to preach and access their congregations.

In May, two courts acquitted six Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, including two U.S. citizens, for proselytizing; the six were arrested initially in 2020. As in prior years, human rights groups reported that police arrested individuals for slaughtering cows or oxen in several districts. Multiple religious groups in the country continued to reiterate that the constitutional and criminal code provisions governing religious conversion and proselytism were vague and contradictory and opened the door for prosecution for actions carried out in the normal course of practicing one\u2019s religion. In February, an informal parliamentary group in the United Kingdom issued a report saying that freedom of religion is under threat in the country because \u201ccriminal laws are being excessively used or abused against persons because of their religion or belief.\u201d\n\nTibetan Buddhist community leaders highlighted an increased ability to celebrate some religious and cultural holidays without police interference during the year. The government allowed Tibetan Buddhists to celebrate nonpolitical events including Losar (Tibetan New Year), the Dalai Lama\u2019s birthday, and other religious events, but with the stipulation that they celebrated in small numbers within refugee settlement compounds. In a departure from previous observances of the Dalai Lama\u2019s birthday, government authorities did not prohibit the display of the Dalai Lama\u2019s portrait as the highest spiritual leader and former head of the state of Tibet. Christian religious leaders continued to express concern about the anti-Christian sentiment of the Royalist/Monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), which seeks to reestablish the country as a Hindu state. Christian groups continued to report difficulties operating as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and multiple religiously affiliated organizations reported increased challenges renewing or registering their organizations during the year. Christian groups said they continued to face difficulties buying or using land for burials, especially within the Kathmandu Valley.\n\nAccording to NGOs, Hindu priests and other \u201chigh-caste\u201d individuals continued to discriminate against persons of \u201clower\u201d castes, particularly Dalits, although the law prohibits caste-based discrimination. An elected ward chairman and two other individuals from the Bajura District of western Nepal assaulted a Dalit man on September 29 for entering a Hindu temple, according to media reports.

The constitution also states there shall be a \u201cjust and equitable balance\u201d in the apportionment of cabinet and high-level civil service positions among the major religious groups, a provision amended by the Taif Agreement, which ended the country\u2019s civil war and mandated proportional representation between Christians and Muslims in parliament, the cabinet, and other senior government positions.\n\nSome members of unregistered religious groups, such as Baha\u2019is, and unrecognized Protestant faiths, continued to list themselves as belonging to recognized religious groups to ensure their marriage and other personal status documents remained legally valid. At year\u2019s end, the parliament, elected in May, had failed to elect a new president and approve a fully empowered cabinet. Some analysts identified the country\u2019s sectarian-based political system for the ongoing political gridlock and economic collapse. Christian and Muslim leaders continued to fear that civil marriage would threaten their ability to administer their own confessional affairs. Couples who wanted a nonreligious ceremony typically travelled to countries where civil marriages are allowed, such as Cyprus.\n\nOn June 19, Lebanese authorities, citing the country\u2019s 1955 \u201canti-Israel boycott law,\u201d detained and questioned the Maronite Archbishop of Haifa and the Holy Land, Moussa al-Hajj, as he attempted to travel from Israel into the country. Authorities seized medicines, food, and $460,000 in cash donated by Lebanese nationals living in Israel that the archbishop was planning to distribute in Lebanon. Some supporters of the archbishop who are opposed to Hizballah stated that this was an example of the terrorist group using government institutions and security agencies to target the Maronite Church. According to media reports, Minister of Interior Bassam Mawlawi issued an order to the Internal Security Forces (ISF) and the Directorate of General Security (DGS) on June 24 to ban any \u201cgatherings, events, or meetings promoting homosexuality,\u201d stating that his order followed \u201ccommunications from religious figures rejecting this phenomenon.\u201d\n\nHizballah, a U.S.- designated Foreign Terrorist Organization and Specially Designated Global Terrorist Group, continued to exercise influence over some areas, particularly the southern suburbs of Beirut, parts of the Beka\u2019a Valley, and southern areas of the country that are predominantly Shia Muslim. In areas under Hizballah\u2019s influence, independent nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) faced harassment and intimidation, including social, political, and financial pressures. Analysts said Hizballah fears losing its \u201cstate-within-a-state privileges\u201d and its ability to maintain arms \u201cbeyond the control of the state.\u201d The head of Hizballah\u2019s parliamentary wing, Muhammad Raad, threatened a renewed civil war if members of parliament (MPs) opposed to Hizballah moved forward with attempts to disarm the group.\n\nIn August, media outlets reported that journalist and television host Dima Sadek was the target of a hostile campaign on social media, following her posting of a photograph of the deceased Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini with the caption \u201cThe Satanic Verses.\u201d In April, a local man attempted to sell a copy of a Torah that he recovered from the ruins of an ancient synagogue in Sidon; the Jewish community filed suit to stop the sale. The NGO Adyan reported that individuals who identified as atheists or agnostics faced restrictions that often compelled them to refrain from expressing their views. In February, a mall located in a predominantly Christian neighborhood in East Beirut dismissed a female employee for wearing a hijab while on the job. On March 13, Christian and Muslim leaders held an interfaith meeting in Tripoli to stress the importance of solidarity between the faiths. Muslim and Christian community leaders said relationships among individual members of different religious groups continued to be amicable.\n\nThe Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officers engaged government officials to encourage tolerance, dialogue, and mutual respect among religious communities and to highlight the importance of combatting violent extremism. The Ambassador spoke with Christian, Shia, Sunni, and Druze religious leaders throughout the year to discuss the impact of the economic situation on different religious communities. Embassy public outreach and assistance programs continued to emphasize tolerance for all religious groups, including through interfaith programs.",

Restrictions on freedom of religion remained widespread outside the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR), and Iraqi security forces (ISF) committed violence against and harassed members of minority groups, according to religious leaders and representatives of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Activities that promote the normalization of relations with Israel have long been illegal, with penalties as severe as life in prison and a law passed in May that reinstated the death penalty as a potential sentence. The legal code also prohibits Jews from joining the military and holding jobs in the public sector.\n\nAs in previous years, there were credible reports that government forces, including the Federal Police, the National Security Service (NSS), and the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), abused and tortured individuals \u2013 particularly Sunni Arabs \u2013 during arrest and pretrial detention and after conviction. Yezidis, Christians, and local and international NGOs reported continued verbal harassment and physical abuse from members of the PMF, a state-sponsored organization composed of approximately 60 mostly militia groups. Shia Arabs compose most popular mobilization unit members, while Christian, Yezidi, Sunni Arab, and other minority groups run their own PMF units, generally operating within or near their home regions. All units officially report to the chairman of the Popular Mobilization Commission and are under the ultimate authority of the Prime Minister, but Iranian leaders and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps influenced the activities of several units. In November, Sunni members of parliament warned that PMF forces and associated Iran-aligned militias continued to prevent displaced Sunnis in Salah al-Din, Diyala, and Ninewa Provinces from returning to their areas of origin. According to the Kurdistan Regional Government\u2019s (KRG) Yezidi Rescue Coordinating Office, 2,693 Yezidis remained missing following ISIS\u2019s assault on the north of the country in 2014, compared to the 2,763 reported as missing in 2021. During protracted government formation negotiations, religious and ethnic minority leaders were largely sidelined from the national power-sharing discussions. After October 2021 parliamentary elections, many minority community leaders complained that larger and more powerful parties \u2013 predominately Shia and Kurdish parties \u2013 succeeded in bolstering their preferred candidates for parliamentary quota seats reserved for minority communities, so that nonminority parties had significant influence in electing representatives for minority communities. Outside the IKR, members of minority communities, including Christians and Yezidis, said that despite occasional verbal harassment from local authorities, the central government generally did not interfere with their religious observances. In June, the Council of Representatives (COR) allocated 25 billion dinars ($17.1 million) to support implementation of the Yezidi Survivors Law that mandates financial and psychosocial support for Yezidi and other survivors of the 2014 genocide by ISIS.\n\nAccording to Iraqi security sources, ISIS relies on kidnapping workers, merchants, and farmers, and demanding ransom to finance its activities in Salah al-Din and Diyala P Members of minority religious groups, including Christians and Yezidis, said the presence of armed affiliates of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, and PMF militias in Sinjar and the Ninewa Plain, as well as continued Turkish airstrikes targeting alleged PKK positions, continued to endanger residents and hinder the return of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The Yezidi community in Sinjar reported in April that the PKK had kidnapped hundreds of Yezidi children to recruit and subject them to ideological \u201cbrainwashing\u201d in the years since ISIS was defeated in Sinjar in 2015, although it was unclear how many of these kidnappings occurred during the year. During the year, officials found three mass graves containing victims of ISIS and the Baathist regime, in Ninewa, Muthana, and Najaf Provinces. According to the central government\u2019s Martyrs Foundation, 242 mass graves containing victims of al-Qaeda, ISIS, and the Baathist regime had been found in the country as of year\u2019s end. In November, a delegation representing the UN Committee on Forced Disappearances visited the country and released a public statement saying the delegation had received \u201cworrying information about patterns of disappearances and alleged enforced disappearances that currently occur in different governorates, which operate simultaneously and sometimes demonstrate scenarios of collusion between State agents and non-State actors,\u201d including \u201calleged enforced disappearance of children, especially of Yezidi origin, who were born following the rape of their mothers by Daesh [ISIS].\u201d\n\nThere were continued reports of societal violence by sectarian armed groups across the country, except in the IKR. Although media and human rights organizations said security conditions in many parts of the country continued to improve, reports of societal violence, mainly by Iran-aligned militia groups, continued. Members of non-Muslim minority groups reported abductions, threats, pressure, and harassment to force them to observe Islamic customs.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the Consulate General in Erbil addressed at the highest levels a full range of religious freedom concerns in the country through frequent meetings with senior government officials, including with Prime Minister Mohammed Shiaa al-Sudani and former prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, through interagency coordination groups, and in targeted assistance programs for stabilization projects. A U.S. delegation met with members of religious and ethnic groups in Baghdad and Erbil on numerous occasions throughout the year. The groups voiced their concerns regarding the presence of armed groups harassing members of those religious groups and promoting and enabling demographic changes, a lack of available resources for stabilization and rehabilitation efforts for internally displaced Christians, Yezidis, and members of other minority groups, and general safety concerns. The Ambassador and other U.S. officials met regularly with national and regional government officials, members of parliament, and parliamentary committees to emphasize the need for the security, full inclusion, tolerance, and protection of the rights of members of minority religious groups. Embassy officials met with Shia, Sunni, Christian, and other religious-group representatives to underscore U.S. support for these communities and to assess the needs and challenges they continued to face.",

It also states, \u201cA person of the Qadiani group or the Lahori group (who call themselves Ahmadis) is a non-Muslim.\u201d The constitution and penal code also prohibit Ahmadis from acting as Muslims. Speech or action intended to incite religious hatred is punishable by up to seven years in prison.\n\nAccording to media reports, police at times killed, physically abused, or failed to protect members of religious minorities. The courts continued to enforce blasphemy laws, punishment for which ranged up to the death penalty, although the government has never executed anyone for blasphemy. According to civil society organizations, at least 52 persons were accused of blasphemy or related religion-based criminal charges during the year, the majority of whom were Ahmadi Muslims. According to civil society reports, at least four individuals charged with blasphemy during previous years received death sentences in 2022, two Christians and two Muslims. In one of those cases, a judge converted a life sentence for blasphemy to a death sentence. In other cases, courts overturned some blasphemy convictions upon appeal and acquitted or granted bail to individuals who had spent years in prison on blasphemy charges. According to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), police failed to protect people accused of blasphemy, although in one instance, police prevented an individual from being lynched for alleged blasphemy. In August, the Ministry of the Interior ordered the Punjab provincial government to take action against the Center for Social Justice (CSJ), an NGO, for a report it and other NGOs submitted to the UN Human Rights Council that described incidents of forced conversion of Christians and misuse of the country\u2019s laws against blasphemy in violation of international human rights obligations and the country\u2019s own laws. The government considered the NGO report \u201canti-government propaganda,\u201d according to the media. In October, the government announced the creation of a dedicated unit to investigate and handle blasphemy allegations online and on social media like other cybercrimes. In November, local police in Chiniot, Punjab, in coordination with the Federal Investigative Agency (FIA) Cyber Crime Wing, charged the national spokesperson for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of Pakistan under blasphemy laws and attempted to arrest him in Rabwah, Punjab. The UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief said the country\u2019s blasphemy laws were a violation of human rights and religious freedom. NGOs active on religious freedom issues reported harassment by government authorities.\n\nAhmadiyya community leaders continued to report they were affected by discriminatory and ambiguous legislation and court judgments that denied them basic rights, including issuance of national identification cards, driver\u2019s licenses, and passports. The Ahmadiyya community reported that police registered 49 cases against Ahmadi Muslims under these laws during the year, the majority of which were for \u201cpretending to be Muslims.\u201d Ahmadi Muslims also remained barred from representation on the National Commission for Minorities within the Ministry of Religious Affairs.\n\nNGOs expressed concern that authorities often failed to intervene in instances of societal violence against religious minorities due to fear of retaliation, inadequate staff, or apathy and that perpetrators of such abuses often faced no legal consequences due to a lack of follow-through by law enforcement, bribes offered by the accused, and pressure on victims to drop cases. Throughout the year, some government officials and politicians engaged in anti-Ahmadi rhetoric and attended events that Ahmadi Muslims said incited violence against their community. In December, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the government would protect the rights of all religious minorities and ensure them a safe environment, and authorities continued military and law enforcement operations against violent groups. According to Ahmadi civil society groups, however, the government failed to restrict advertisements or speeches inciting anti-Ahmadi violence, as provided in the National Action Plan against terrorism.\n\nThroughout the year, unidentified individuals and mobs targeted and killed Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, Ahmadi Muslims, Sunni Muslims, and Shia Muslims in attacks believed to be motivated by religion or accusations of blasphemy, or described as religion-based, according to some faith leaders. According to the NGO website South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), the number of sectarian attacks and killings by armed groups increased slightly compared with 2021, reversing the overall decline in terrorist attacks reported in previous years.\n\nHuman rights activists reported numerous instances of societal violence related to allegations of blasphemy; of efforts by individuals to coerce religious minorities to convert to Islam; and of societal harassment, discrimination, and threats of violence directed at members of religious minority communities. NGOs expressed concern about what they stated was the increasing frequency of attempts to kidnap, forcibly convert, and forcibly marry young women and girls from religious minority communities, especially Hindus and Christians. Estimates of the number of forced or coerced conversions vary widely \u2013 from as few as five per year to as many as 500. The NGO Center for Social Justice recorded 124 cases of forced or coerced conversions of young women and girls through marriage during the year, an increase of 59 percent over the organization\u2019s count of 78 cases in the previous year. There continued to be reports of attacks on Ahmadi, Hindu, and Christian holy places, cemeteries, and religious symbols. Civil society groups and some religious leaders continued to express concerns about the safety of religious minorities.\n\nSenior U.S. Department of State officials, including the Counselor of the Department of State, the Ambassador, and Consuls General, as well as other U.S. embassy officers, met with government officials, including senior advisors to the Prime Minister, officials from the Ministries of Law and Justice and Foreign Affairs and senior members of the Senate and National Assembly to urge them to make progress on religious freedom issues. These included blasphemy laws, laws concerning Ahmadi Muslims, protecting all religious minorities, sectarian relations, and interfaith respect. In September the Ambassador met with interfaith leaders at Badshahi Mosque to promote peaceful religious coexistence. The Ambassador highlighted the U.S. government\u2019s commitment to religious freedom and discussed efforts in the country to improve interfaith tolerance, inclusion, and harmony. In September, the Counselor of the Department of State visited Jamia Islamia Clifton Madrassah in Karachi, where he was joined by the Karachi Administrator and an interfaith group of local religious leaders with whom he discussed how flood assistance packages would directly aid the people of the province, including minority religious communities.\n\nEmbassy and consulate general officers continued to engage civil society leaders, local religious leaders, religious minority group representatives, and legal experts to discuss ways to combat intolerance and promote interfaith cooperation to increase religious freedom. The embassy and consulates general highlighted the principles of religious freedom and examples of interfaith dialogue in the United States on their social media platforms and organized several outreach events throughout the year.\n\nOn November 30, the Secretary of State redesignated Pakistan as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as amended, for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom and announced a waiver of the sanctions that accompany designation in the national interest of the United States.",

An antihate law criminalizes political party activities promoting \u201cfascism, intolerance, or hatred.\u201d\n\nThe regime at times extended the antihate law to include religious figures. In May, the governor of Carabobo State sued Father Alfredo Infante, Superior of the Jesuits in Venezuela and the human rights coordinator of a Jesuit-run nongovernmental organization (NGO), for defamation following the March 14 release of the NGO PROVEA\u2019s annual human rights report, to which the Jesuit NGO contributed. Representatives of the conference of Roman Catholic bishops, officially known as the Catholic Episcopal Conference of Venezuela (CEV), and the Evangelical Council of Venezuela (ECV), said regime leaders and loyalists verbally harassed clergy and other members of their religious communities for continuing to call attention to the country\u2019s humanitarian crisis and for other criticisms of the regime. The Catholic Church expressed concern for the country\u2019s migration crisis and continued to press for a negotiated solution to social and political issues.\n\nAccording to Jewish community representatives, the regime and those sympathetic to it, including some regime-affiliated media outlets, increased their antisemitic rhetoric during the year. Diosdado Cabello, vice president of the regime-affiliated political party United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), called David Smolansky, Organization for American States (OAS) Commissioner for the Venezuelan Migrants and Refugee Crisis, a \u201cZionist\u201d and a \u201cfascist\u201d during his television program in which Cabello showed \u201cwanted\u201d posters of several opposition leaders.

The government continued to limit the rights of non-Muslim religious minorities, especially those not recognized under the government\u2019s interpretation of the 1923 Lausanne Treaty, which includes only Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Christians, Jews, and Greek Orthodox Christians. The government continued to treat Alevi Islam as a heterodox Muslim \u201csect,\u201d categorized Alevi worship as cultural rather than religious, and did not recognize Alevi houses of worship.

Antisemitic discourse and hate speech continued in social and print media. In May, a Jewish Community website warned that a group was circulating antisemitic messages on social media targeting two hospitals where management reportedly did not permit women staff to wear Islamic headscarves. According to the Jewish website, a Jewish manager was singled out for imposing the reported policy.\n\nIn September, the U.S. Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom discussed protection of religious minorities and refugees fleeing religious persecution with government leaders, civil society, and diverse faith communities in Ankara and Istanbul.

Several religious groups, however, continued to express frustration that the government required them to register as both civil associations and religious groups to be eligible for benefits that the Catholic Church received without registration. In March, the Argentinian Council for Religious Freedom (CALIR) expressed concern that some local governments requested an additional registration for religious groups at the municipal level. In July, the National Institute against Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Racism (INADI), together with representatives of different religious entities and organizations, created a 2022-23 Working Group for the Prevention of Discrimination based on Religion. On the 28th anniversary of the bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) community center, President Alberto Fernandez reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to achieve justice for the attack and fight antisemitism. In February, Salta provincial police dispersed a group of Muslim women who tried to celebrate World Hijab Day, even though they had municipal permission for the event.\n\nDuring the year, media, government authorities, and civil society organizations reported individuals in the country experienced incidents of discrimination based on religion in the forms of violence, hate speech, and misinformation. The Delegation of Argentine Jewish Associations (DAIA) cited 490 incidents of antisemitism in its annual report for 2021, released in September, or 3 percent less than in 2020. DAIA\u2019s report also noted an increase in the number of cases reaching the justice system. There were also threats and antisemitic comments in social media. According to media reports and the Islam for Peace Institute, during the year, members of the Muslim community experienced incidents of religious discrimination. Interreligious groups such as the Interreligious Committee for Peace in Argentina, whose members include Catholic, Protestant, evangelical Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Baha\u2019i, as well as Indigenous religious groups and CALIR, continued work to promote tolerance and increase opportunities for interreligious action on common societal challenges.\n\nU.S. embassy officials met with senior government officials, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship\u2019s (MFA) Secretariat of Worship and human rights office, to discuss ways to promote respect for religious minorities and counteract religious discrimination. The Ambassador promoted the importance of religious tolerance with a diverse, high-profile group of religious and nonreligious leaders when he hosted the embassy\u2019s first iftar in April. On July 18, the Ambassador, the U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, and other embassy officials attended the annual commemoration to mourn the victims of the 1994 terrorist attack on the AMIA. The Ambassador also held multiple meetings with AMIA, DAIA, and other religious groups throughout the year. Embassy officials supported interfaith cooperation and universal respect for freedom of religion through public statements and social media postings as well as in meetings with religious groups.",

The CNRD\u2019s Transition Charter, which serves in lieu of a constitution, states the country is a secular state and any act undermining the secular nature of the state or one\u2019s religious freedom is to be considered a \u201chigh crime\u201d punishable by fines and imprisonment. The penal code provides for freedom of worship within limits defined by the law. In addition, the Transition Charter stipulates that two members of the National Transition Council, the current national legislative body, are to be religious community representatives.\n\nThe cabinet-level Secretariat General of Religious Affairs (SRA) continued to issue weekly themes for inclusion in Friday sermons at mosques and Sunday sermons in churches. Although the SRA did not control sermons at every mosque and church, its inspectors continued to be present in every region and were responsible for ensuring that mosque and church sermons were consistent with SRA directives. In September, the SRA prohibited an imam from preaching and accused him of \u201cgross misconduct\u201d after he posted a video on social media in which he criticized the President of the Transition (the interim president). A Wahhabi mosque, closed by local authorities in September 2021 for noncompliance with government regulations regarding places of worship, reopened for Friday prayers in February following a conflict-resolution mission by the Secretary General of the SRA. Following a two-year suspension due to COVID-19, the annual Muslim pilgrimage resumed, with the SRA authorizing 4,527 pilgrims to travel to Mecca.\n\nIn February, the Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization attempted to resolve a long-running land dispute between an Indigenous Muslim Susu group and the Catholic monastery in Kendoumaya, Lower Guinea. Both sides welcomed the government\u2019s intervention, but by year\u2019s end, the dispute was not resolved and a number of related legal cases remained pending in the courts. In May, the marriage of a well-known Christian journalist to a Muslim woman fueled widespread public debate about interfaith marriages and created social and religious tension, according in the press and on social media. The parents of the woman requested the authorities to annul the marriage. The controversy led a blogger to form a movement in support of the woman\u2019s family against the marriage and to organize a demonstration to protest the marriage. Authorities arrested and prosecuted the blogger for posting threats and insults on social media likely to disturb the public order; he was later released under judicial supervision.\n\nThe Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officials met on multiple occasions with SRA officials, the Grand Imam, the Catholic Archbishop of Conakry, Baha\u2019i leaders, and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to discuss religious tolerance, reconciliation, and social cohesion. In April, the Ambassador hosted an iftar with U.S. government-funded exchange program alumni, fostering a cross-cultural discussion on issues of religious tolerance and diversity in the country. Funding from the U.S. President\u2019s Malaria Initiative supported training for Islamic leaders to incorporate messaging to counter malaria into their sermons and religious ceremonies.

The constitution states, \u201cReligious associations shall be separate from the state and shall not interfere in state affairs.\u201d The law restricts Islamic prayer to specific locations, regulates the registration and location of mosques, and prohibits persons younger than 18 from participating in public religious activities. The government\u2019s Committee on Religion, Regulation of Traditions, Celebrations, and Ceremonies (CRA) maintains a broad mandate that includes approving registration of religious associations, construction of houses of worship, participation of children in religious education, and the dissemination of religious literature.\n\nJehovah\u2019s Witnesses continued to seek registration, an effort begun in 2007, and some adherents stated authorities harassed them. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses member Shamil Khakimov, imprisoned in 2019 for \u201cinciting religious hatred\u201d after police found Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses literature and a Tajiki-language Bible in his home, continued to serve a four-and-a-half-year sentence. Khakimov\u2019s health reportedly declined further during the year, according to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses sources. On September 7, the UN Human Rights Committee published a ruling that endorsed a complaint by the Religious Association of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Dushanbe (RAJW) that stated the government had violated their rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). According to the NGO Forum 18, CRA Chair Sulaymon Davlatzoda announced to Protestant church leaders in May that the CRA would no longer register any new churches.\n\nHanafi Sunni mosques continued to enforce a religious edict issued by the government-supported Ulema Council prohibiting women from praying at those mosques. In September, authorities \u201ctemporarily\u201d closed Dushanbe bookstores specializing in religious literature to review what they termed the \u201cillegal import and sale of religious books.\u201d The government reported law enforcement agencies continued to arrest and detain individuals suspected of membership in, or of supporting, groups banned by the government, including those that advocated for Islamic political goals and presented themselves as political opponents of the government. In May, the government undertook what it called an \u201cantiterrorist operation\u201d in response to protests in the Gorno-Badakhshon Autonomous (GBAO) Region, which is populated by the ethnically and religiously distinct Pamiri minority. Authorities arrested protesters, activists, and journalists on charges that, for some, included extremism or collaboration with banned political groups. Because religion, ethnicity, and politics are closely linked, it is difficult to categorize these incidents as being solely based on religious identity.\n\nOn August 4, the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Tajiki-language outlet Radio Ozodi reported that the GBAO regional court sentenced Muzaffar Davlatmirov, a 58-year-old Ismaili cleric, to five years\u2019 imprisonment \u201cfor public calls to extremist activities.\u201d Forum 18 stated that with Davlatmirov\u2019s imprisonment, the government had imprisoned at least seven prisoners of conscience for exercising their freedom of religion or belief. Six were Muslim; one was a member of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. A July 28 Eurasianet report detailed several actions authorities reportedly took to pressure Aga Khan-related humanitarian and development entities, which were associated with the Ismaili community and active in the GBAO region.\n\nIndividuals outside government continued to state they were reluctant to discuss issues such as societal respect for religious diversity, including abuses or discrimination based on religious belief, due to fear of government harassment. Civil society representatives said discussion of religion in general, especially relations among different religious groups, remained a subject they avoided.\n\nThroughout the year, the Ambassador and other U.S. embassy and State Department officials encouraged the government to adhere to its commitments to respect religious freedom. The Ambassador and embassy officers discussed freedom of religion and belief and advocated for an imprisoned member of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses during interactions with the government. Embassy officers raised concerns regarding the restrictions on participation of women and minors in religious services, restrictions on the religious education of youth, and the situation facing Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in the country. During annual bilateral consultations on May 25 in Dushanbe, U.S. officials raised concerns over the country\u2019s implementation of its international obligations concerning freedom of religion or belief. These included urging the government to ease religious restrictions, free an imprisoned member of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and follow through on its stated intention to invite the UN special rapporteur for freedom of religion or belief to visit the country.\n\nIn 2016, the country was designated as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom. On November 30, 2022, the Secretary of State redesignated the country as a CPC and announced a waiver of the required sanctions that accompany designation in the \u201cimportant national interest of the United States.\u201d",

Sunni and Shia Muslims and eight Christian denominations constitute the registered religious groups in the country. Unregistered religious groups are illegal, but authorities generally permitted them to practice their faith privately. Proselytizing for any faith other than Islam is prohibited.\n\nIn an annex to a March 2 report, the then UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief stated authorities discriminated against Baha\u2019is when applying personal status laws, and some Baha\u2019is \u201cwere reportedly subject to administrative deportations and blacklisting resulting in loss of employment, income, and separation of families.\u201d On March 11, the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Baha\u2019i International Community (BIC) stated cumulative instances of discrimination, restrictions, and human rights violations threatened the viability of the community in the country. In November, the NGO Humanists UK stated the government repressed expressions of core humanist principles. On August 16, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOCI) ordered merchants and shopping malls to refrain from selling or displaying goods that were noncompliant with Islamic values, such as toys with rainbow colors, which are often associated with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) pride. Between November 20 and December 18, the country hosted the FIFA 2022 Men\u2019s World Cup. Media reported that during the tournament, the government produced materials and supported activities designed to proselytize to visitors on behalf of Islam at venues such as local mosques and tourist sites. Officials said symbols of LGBTQI+ pride such as rainbow flags and gear were allowed, but security personnel did not consistently apply this permission. There were no reports of discrimination against individuals based on their religious affiliation in connection with World Cup activities.\n\nA ban on worship outside the Mesaymeer Religious Complex, which the government described as temporary when instituted in 2020 to limit the spread of COVID-19 and for security reasons, remained in effect. The complex, located on government land, provided worship space for the eight registered Christian denominations, with approximately 75,000 to 100,000 expatriate Christians reportedly attending weekly services there. Citizens of the country and other Muslims were not allowed to attend services in the complex. The Christian Churches Steering Committee (CCSC), composed of representatives of the churches permitted to operate in the complex, wrote multiple letters to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on behalf of \u201cvilla\u201d (house) churches requesting to meet to discuss additional real estate for Christian worship but received no reply by year\u2019s end. In July, the NGO Institute for the Monitoring of Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-se) concluded, based on its ongoing review of the country\u2019s textbooks, that the government made the greatest degree of progress in removing material containing antisemitic content, while it made minor progress in reducing content that conveyed hate towards non-Muslims and encouraged violent jihad. In September, the nomination of the country\u2019s envoy to the United Nations in Geneva, Hend al-Muftah, to chair the UN Human Rights Forum was rejected because of her previous antisemitic and homophobic social media posts. Members of the government-allied International Union of Muslim Scholars (IUMS) publicly framed homosexuality as an affront to Islam.\n\nIn June, commenters in traditional and social media responded negatively to statements regarding the Prophet Muhammad made by two ruling party Hindu officials in India. The editor of the al-Watan daily newspaper called Indians \u201cthe dirtiest\u201d and Hinduism \u201cdirty.\u201d NGOs Open Doors USA and Middle East Concern stated indigenous converts to Christianity faced extreme pressure from their Muslim families and community, including, in extreme cases, violence. Many journalists framed homosexuality in religious terms. In May, a columnist in al-Sharq called homosexuals \u201cperverts\u201d and said monkeypox was \u201ca warning from Allah.\u201d\n\nU.S. State Department and U.S. embassy officials continued to meet with senior government officials, relevant government bodies, and quasigovernmental religious institutions concerning the rights of religious minorities, Sunni-Shia relations, and antisemitism. Throughout the year, embassy officers met with various faith communities, including the Hindu, Shia Muslim, Baha\u2019i, and evangelical Christian communities, and with the CCSC, which oversees a variety of Christian denominations, to discuss issues of mutual concern.

Some Shia and Ahmadi Muslims reported feeling marginalized and anti-Shia rhetoric was common in some online media outlets and on social media. Individuals affiliated at the local level with the Indonesian Council of Ulemas (MUI), a national, quasi-governmental Muslim clerical body, used rhetoric considered intolerant by religious minorities, including against Shia and Ahmadi Muslims.

The law prohibits all religious activity by unregistered groups and requires all registered religious groups to obtain permits to proselytize or hold events outside of their premises, as well as prior approval from the authorities to import and distribute religious literature. During the year, the government increased the penalty for activities conducted by unregistered religious groups from a fine to imprisonment of two years.\n\nAuthorities continued to use laws regulating \u201cmass events\u201d to target members of the clergy and members of religious groups engaged in the prodemocracy movement that emerged following the 2020 fraudulent presidential election, as well as those protesting Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Authorities detained numerous religious leaders in connection with these protests and also for reasons such as holding unauthorized baptisms, posting material on social media from a television station based in Poland deemed \u201cextremist\u201d by the regime, and publicly displaying materials from the political opposition. Human rights organizations said authorities restricted clergy access to prisons and denied pastoral visits to some political prisoners. According to observers, authorities continued surveillance of registered and unregistered religious groups, including through monitoring of social media. Following a fire in September, authorities evicted the congregation and barred access to the Catholic Church of St. Simon and St. Helena in Minsk, which has been subject to years-long tax and property disputes between the government and Catholic Church. In September, authorities prevented the New Life Church, engaged in a years-long tax dispute with authorities, from holding services in the parking lot of the building the church formerly occupied; authorities had removed the congregation from the building in February 2021. While BOC Metropolitan Veniamin remained neutral in his statements on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, lower-level BOC leaders amplified Russia\u2019s propaganda on the war.\n\nThere were antisemitic comments on social media and in the comment sections of local online news articles, but the origin of some of the comments was undetermined. Several religious groups reported instances of vandalism of their properties. Interdenominational Christian groups continued to work together on education and charitable projects and also held seminars on issues related to interreligious and cross-cultural traditions and other topics.\n\nThe Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires and other U.S. Embassy officials engaged on religious freedom issues, including registration of religious communities, state pressure on clergy, freedom to express and practice religious beliefs, freedom of expression for clergy who participated in activities that the state considered political, and antisemitism. The Charg\u00e9 and other embassy officials met with Jewish groups to discuss antisemitism and the preservation of Jewish cultural heritage and participated in a November event in Minsk commemorating Holocaust victims. The Charg\u00e9 and other embassy representatives also engaged Orthodox Christians, Roman Catholics, Protestants, and other groups, as well as civil society activists, to learn about their religious activities and to discuss the regime\u2019s actions affecting the exercise of religious freedom.",

Religious leaders said they had generally positive working relationships with the government but that some government officials continued to believe that members of certain religious denominations were automatically loyal to specific political figures. While secularism is embedded in national law, one religious leader said the state had sometimes preferred certain religions over others in such matters as allocation of government financial support and tax exonerations for religious groups. The government temporarily detained a Christian pastor for what it said was threatening public order with inflammatory comments on social media. While some religious leaders called for his arrest, another such leader expressed concern that the arrest infringed on freedom of speech. The government accredited 547 Islamic schools, a sharp increase, as Muslim advocacy groups pushed Islamic schools to adopt the standard curriculum and seek accreditation. The government continued to fund Christian religious pilgrimages and resumed doing so for Muslims after Saudi Arabia lifted some COVID-19 travel restrictions.\n\nMuslim and Christian leaders, including representatives of the Supreme Council of Imams, Mosques, and Islamic Affairs of Cote d\u2019Ivoire (COSIM, the country\u2019s main Sunni Muslim association) and the Catholic, evangelical Christian, and Methodist Churches, reported generally good relations with each other and among their communities, although there were two reported instances of local Christian and Muslim groups disagreeing over the use of land to build additional churches. Additionally, there were two localized conflicts between animists and a Christian denomination over the right to hold Christian worship services at the same time as certain animist ceremonies. The incidents involved vandalism against churches. In one case, a Christian suffered a broken collarbone. Religious leaders and civil society representatives continued to state that in light of the importance of religion in society, religious leaders were seen as influential in maintaining peace and reconciliation and guarding against political manipulation of national identity, ethnicity, and religious differences to foment division in the country. They also stated religious leaders were broadly united in working together to accomplish these objectives. Some Muslim leaders stated their community acted to prevent the influence of what they called intolerant forms of Islam, including providing imams with suggested themes for sermons, advising imams to closely vet guest preachers, and requiring traveling Muslim preachers to obtain advance approval of their sermons from local Muslim authorities. Several Christian denominations also monitored hate speech and provided antiextremist training.\n\nU.S. embassy representatives met with government officials to discuss the state of religious freedom and tolerance in the country. Topics included whether the government had recorded interreligious conflicts or any threats, violence, or harassment that targeted specific religious groups; whether the government had penalized or denied benefits to any religious groups; and the government\u2019s assessment of the threat of religiously motivated violent extremism in the country. The Ambassador and other embassy representatives regularly met with religious leaders in the capital and around the country. The embassy hosted religious community leaders for roundtable discussions on issues including religious tolerance and Christian-Muslim relations.

It states all persons are equal before the law and prohibits discrimination on grounds of religious belief. According to the constitution, sharia is the principal source of legislation, although the judicial system applies both sharia and civil law, depending on the case. The new penal code and electronic crimes law that came into effect in January retain prohibitions on blasphemy, proselytizing by non-Muslims, and acts the government interprets as provoking religious hatred, discrimination, or insulting religions.\n\nThe government, having designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization in 2014, continued to restrict the activities of organizations and individuals allegedly associated with al-Islah, a Muslim Brotherhood affiliate. Police and courts continued to enforce laws prohibiting sorcery, and customs authorities occasionally denied or delayed entry to airline passengers carrying items deemed intended for sorcery, black magic, or witchcraft. There were reports of authorities arresting individuals for practicing black magic and witchcraft. Representatives of non-Islamic faiths again said registration and licensing procedures and requirements for minority religious groups remained unclear in all emirates. In July, the Dubai Community Development Authority (CDA) granted a license to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Church of Jesus Christ) to hold services at a temporary venue ahead of the construction of their temple. The Jewish congregation \u201cGates of the East\u201d maintained its license with the Dubai CDA for religious services while discussions on plans to build a synagogue in Dubai were ongoing. The government continued to permit Shia Muslims to observe Ashura in private but not in public. According to some communities, social distancing measures limited capacity at religious venues, burdening non-Muslim faiths due to the limited number of houses of worship they were permitted, though these measures were ultimately lifted. Some houses of worship reported that pandemic restrictions led to the decline in collections during services.\n\nIn January, the country adopted a four-and-a-half-day workweek, with Friday afternoon, Saturday, and Sunday serving as the new weekend, after previously following the Islamic Sunday-to-Thursday workweek, with Friday and Saturday as its weekend. Unlike the rest of the country, Sharjah adopted a four-day workweek, maintaining the traditional Islamic weekend and adding Sunday as an additional day off.\n\nThe General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (Awqaf) continued to provide weekly guidance for the content of sermons in Sunni mosques with the stated purpose of limiting the spread of what the authorities characterized as extremist ideology. Some Shia imams chose to follow Awqaf-approved guidance, while the Ja\u2019afari Endowments Charitable Councils in Dubai and Sharjah, charged with management of Shia affairs, issued additional instructions to Shia mosques. Government-controlled internet service providers blocked access to websites critical of Islam or supportive of views the government considered religiously extremist. The government prohibited the dissemination of literature it perceived as supporting religious extremism. Minority religious groups said limits on construction of new houses of worship forced denominations to share premises and limited the frequency of prayer services, as well as prevented their relocation from industrial areas that women congregants were reluctant to visit at night. During the year, Abu Dhabi continued construction on the country\u2019s first, purpose-built synagogue.\n\nAccording to non-Muslim religious community representatives, there was a high degree of societal tolerance for minority religious beliefs and traditions, particularly for those associated with houses of worship officially recognized by the federal or local emirate governments. Although conversion from Islam was strongly discouraged, conversion to Islam was encouraged. In some cases, organizations reported that hotels, citing government regulatory barriers, were unwilling to rent space for non-Islamic religious purposes, such as weekly church services. In Dubai, one of two licensed Hindu temples officially inaugurated a new, larger facility in October. The Israeli Pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai, the World\u2019s Fair held from October 2021 to March 2022, partnered with the Crossroads of Civilizations Museum to organize events commemorating International Holocaust Remembrance Day on January 27.\n\nThe U.S. Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires, Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom, and U.S. embassy and consulate general officers engaged government officials on issues pertaining to religious diversity, inclusiveness, and tolerance, as well as licensing procedures and regulatory practices involving religious and religiously affiliated minority groups. They met with representatives of minority religious organizations and community groups, including the Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Sikh, and Baha\u2019i communities, as well as different Islamic groups during the year. In these meetings, U.S. officials discussed the promotion of religious tolerance and emphasized the U.S. government\u2019s commitment to religious freedom. The embassy hosted events during Ramadan bringing together interfaith religious leaders. To mark Holocaust Remembrance Day in January, the embassy organized a documentary screening and discussion with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy.",

The law requires religious education (RE) and worship for children between the ages of three and 18 in state-run schools, although there are opt out provisions.\n\nIn November, a court convicted Abdullah Qureshi of assaulting three Orthodox Jews in two separate attacks in August. The court postponed sentencing to early 2023 pending a mental health evaluation. Media outlets reported that as of year\u2019s end, the Scottish government had not implemented hate crimes legislation passed in 2021, although police encouraged victims to report incidents and said these would be investigated. The law remained contentious among the public and the police force. At year\u2019s end, Parliament had not adopted a working definition of \u201cIslamophobia\u201d; critics said the lack of a definition hindered efforts to fight anti-Muslim sentiment and incidents. After a two-year consultation, the University of Aberdeen decided in October to adopt the Jerusalem Declaration of Antisemitism (JDA) rather than the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition of Antisemitism, saying the JDA offered \u201ca fairer and clearer definition and set of guidelines.\u201d In October, the nongovernmental organization (NGO) National Secular Society publicly called on the government to repeal blasphemy laws in Northern Ireland.\n\nUnder the Places of Worship Scheme, which applied to England, Scotland, and Wales, the government provided \u00a324.5 million ($29.5 million) to Muslim places of worship and schools to fund enhanced security measures and \u00a33.5 million ($4.2 million) to other religious communities for increased security at places of worship and associated faith-based, group-run community centers. The government introduced a separate new program to provide additional protection to Muslim schools. It also provided \u00a314 million ($17 million) between April 2021 and March 2022 through the NGO Community Security Trust (CST) to provide security at Jewish institutions, including schools and synagogues. NGOs called for a Places of Worship Scheme to be introduced in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe main political parties continued to address or face accusations of religious bias. Conservative MP and government minister Nusrat Ghani told the press she was fired from her previous ministerial position because her \u201cMuslimness\u201d made colleagues uncomfortable. The NGO Humanists UK stated that nonreligious belief (i.e., humanist) marriages, which are legally recognized in Scotland and Northern Ireland, should receive legal recognition in England and Wales and that the state should increase the availability of nonpastoral support in prisons and hospitals. In a November statement, Humanists UK chief executive Andrew Copson said the results of the 2021 census showing that 37 percent of the population in England and Wales stated they had \u201cno religion\u201d \u201cshould be a wake-up call which prompts fresh reconsiderations of the role of religion in society.\u201d The NGO Humanist Society Scotland urged people who did not believe in or practice a religion to select \u201cNo religion\u201d on the 2022 Scottish census.\n\nIn May, the Department for Education suspended engagement with and funding for the National Union of Students (NUS) over long-running allegations of antisemitism in the organization, despite the NUS\u2019s pledge to work with Jewish students on an internal investigation. In November, the communications regulator Ofcom found the BBC had made a \u201cserious editorial misjudgment\u201d in its coverage of a November 2021 antisemitic incident in London. A rabbi who was a longtime contributor to BBC programming resigned in January over the broadcaster\u2019s handling of the incident. Numerous public officials, including the Scottish First Minister and the Prime Minister\u2019s Special Envoy for Freedom of Religion or Belief, made public statements supporting religious freedom. In July, the country hosted the International Ministerial Conference on Freedom of Religion or Belief, which brought together representatives from governments, Parliament, religious and belief groups, and civil society.\n\nThe government reported 8,730 religiously motivated hate crimes in England and Wales between March 2021 and March 2022, a 37 percent increase from one year prior. Where the victim\u2019s perceived or known religion was recorded, 40 percent of religious hate crime offenses targeted Muslims, 21 percent targeted Jews, and 8 percent targeted Christians. Other targeted groups included Hindus and Sikhs. The Home Office said the increase in incidents could reflect a real increase in hate crime, improvements in reporting, or the lower levels of incidents that occurred during the previous reporting year, when the country was under COVID-19 restrictions. In Scotland, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) reported 512 religiously motivated crimes in the 12 months ending in March, a 16 percent decrease from the year prior. In Northern Ireland, police reported 54 religiously motivated hate crimes during 2021-22, an increase from 37 crimes reported in 2020-2021, and 780 sectarian crimes where religion was described as being among the motivating factors, a slight decrease from the year prior.\n\nIn March, the NGO Campaign Against Antisemitism published its Antisemitism Barometer 2021, which found that 22 percent of 1,768 Jews surveyed said they felt somewhat or very unwelcome in the country and 46 percent said they did not display visible signs of their Judaism in public due to antisemitism. The survey also found that 57 percent of 1,790 non-Jewish respondents did not hold antisemitic views. CST\u2019s annual report recorded 1,652 antisemitic incidents during the year, including assault, threats, graffiti, damage or desecration of property, and hate mail. In June, the NGOs Muslim Engagement and Development (MEND) and Muslim Census published a survey of 113 mosques (representing 6 percent of mosques in the country), in which 42 percent reported they had experienced religiously motivated incidents since 2019. The incidents involved violence, threats, vandalism, and theft. In June, the Scottish-based data research firm Savanta published a survey that found 69 percent of employed Muslims reported some sort of anti-Muslim behavior during work-related encounters, and Black Muslims reported experiencing the highest incidence of workplace anti-Muslim discrimination. In April, a coalition of Christian organizations published a study that found non-Christians had a more negative view of the \u201cChristian Church\u201d than of individual Christians they knew.\n\nU.S. embassy and consulate general staff in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Bermuda engaged with government officials and political parties as well as a broad spectrum of religious communities and civil society groups, including humanist groups, to broaden understanding of, and advocacy for, freedom of religion and belief. Senior State Department officials, including the U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, and the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, visited the country during the year to engage with government, religious, and civil society representatives to promote religious freedom and counter antisemitism.",

Federal Member State (FMS) administrations, including Puntland, Jubaland, South West State, Hirshabelle, Galmudug, and self-declared independent Somaliland, govern their respective jurisdictions through local legislation but do not fully control them. Somaliland\u2019s constitution declares Islam its official religion, prohibits Muslims from converting to another religion, bars the propagation of any religion other than Islam, and requires all laws to comply with the general principles of sharia.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Education, Culture, and Higher Education continued to implement its curriculum, declaring that a secular education with a focus on Islamic values and instruction in Somali was important in order to counter efforts by the Islamic fundamentalist terrorist group al-Shabaab to impose a strict version of Islamic law. During the year, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud emphasized education in the government\u2019s fight against al-Shabaab, publicly committing to revive education in areas liberated from the group.\n\nAl-Shabaab continued to attack government-linked forces and targets and civilians throughout the country during the year. The group also continued to pressure civilians to support its extremist ideology. According to media reports, al-Shabaab killed, injured, or harassed persons for a variety of reasons, including failure to adhere to the group\u2019s religious edicts. During the year, al-Shabaab was responsible for the killings of civilians, government officials, government security forces, police, and troops from contributing countries of the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS). The United Nations estimated that al-Shabaab attacks had killed 613 civilians and injured 948 by mid-November, the highest number of such casualties since 2017 and a third more than in 2021. Al-Shabaab continued its campaign to characterize the ATMIS forces as \u201cChristian crusaders\u201d intent on invading and occupying the country. During the year, the group conducted public executions of persons whom it accused of committing crimes such as blasphemy and spying, according to local and international press reports. Al-Shabaab continued its practice of targeting humanitarian aid workers, often accusing them of seeking to convert individuals to Christianity, but violence against aid workers decreased compared to 2021, with no incident directly targeting NGOs during the first half of the year.\n\nStrong societal pressure to adhere to Sunni Islamic traditions continued. Conversion from Islam to another religion remained prohibited in some areas. Those suspected of conversion reportedly faced harassment and intimidation by members of their community.\n\nTravel by U.S. government officials remained limited to select areas when security conditions permitted.

In June, a Cairo court sentenced Salafi preacher Mahmoud Shaaban to 15 years in prison for \u201cinciting violence, opposing the state, and joining a terrorist group.\u201d Shaaban accused authorities of denying him medical treatment while he was incarcerated. The government summoned, tried, and sentenced several individuals, including Muslim, Christian, and atheist authors, social media content creators, and private citizens, for actions deemed offensive to Islam or Christianity. Human rights groups called the religious defamation laws vague, overly broad, and a threat to freedom of expression and called for their repeal. Authorities released Coptic researcher and activist Ramy Kamel, detained since 2019 for blasphemy, and Quranist Reda Abdel Rahman, detained since 2020 on charges including membership in ISIS. The Ministry of Interior pardoned five police officers convicted of torturing a Coptic man to death in 2016 after they had served one year of a three-year sentence. A court released a woman detained for five months after she reported her coworkers had assaulted her for not wearing a hijab.\n\nAn academic writing for a human rights nonprofit organization said nonbelieving Coptic prisoners in the country felt compelled to attend meetings with religious counselors, lest their absence imply atheism, making them \u201cmore vulnerable to violence by jailers and prisoners.\u201d In May, the government approved the full reopening of mosques and shrines, lifting most remaining COVID-19 restrictions, although it maintained the 10-minute limit on Friday sermons and reportedly continued to limit some Sufi celebrations, citing COVID-19 concerns. The government continued to allow Baha\u2019is, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Church of Jesus Christ), Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and Shia Muslims to worship privately in small numbers, but it continued to deny their requests to hold public religious gatherings or build houses of worship. Baha\u2019is continued legal action to have authorities designate a cemetery for individuals whom the government considered not to be Muslim, Christian, or Jewish. The government continued to restrict the content of sermons in mosques. In September, authorities released the National Counterterrorism Report, which outlined the roles the Ministry of Awqaf (Islamic Endowments) and al-Azhar al-Sharif (al-Azhar), the main authority on theology and Islamic affairs, played in countering religious extremism. Authorities attempted to monitor websites for \u201cextremist\u201d content and to block Shia websites in general. In June, the Ministry of Education and Technical Education (Ministry of Education) announced grades four through six would begin using a textbook on respect for human rights and religious tolerance that was already in use in grades one through three.\n\nThe government continued the process of registering unlicensed churches that were built prior to 2017, legalizing the status of 125 such churches during the year. Following an accidental fire in a Giza church that killed 41 worshippers in August, church leaders criticized government restrictions on renovating or building churches and poor government emergency preparedness. Human rights groups and some Christian community representatives continued to characterize government-sponsored customary reconciliation sessions as encroaching on the principles of nondiscrimination and citizenship and denying Christians the opportunity to pursue justice through the courts. The nongovernmental organization (NGO) Coptic Solidarity said there was a \u201c2 percent glass ceiling\u201d on Copts in entry-level positions in the judiciary, military, police, and diplomatic corps as well as limits on their participation in the upper ranks of other government positions. On February 8, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi issued a decree appointing Judge Boulos Fahmy Iskandar Boulos, a Copt, to head the Supreme Constitutional Court, the first Christian so appointed. On June 25, the Administrative Court of the State Council ruled it had no jurisdiction in a lawsuit Coptic human rights attorneys filed in 2021 seeking removal of the \u201creligion\u201d field from national identity cards. In April, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities began restoring the historic Ben Ezra Synagogue in Cairo, a nonworking synagogue that functioned as a museum and tourist attraction.\n\nTerrorist groups, including Islamic State-Sinai Peninsula (ISIS-SP), continued sporadic attacks on government, civilian, and security targets in the North Sinai Governorate. In August, terrorist groups killed at least two civilian Copts in Sinai, reportedly based on their religious identity. There were reports during the year of Muslims killing and injuring Copts based on their religious identity. Religious discrimination in private sector hiring continued, according to human rights groups and religious communities, including against the Shia community. Coptic communities continued to report incidents of disappearances of female members of the community that, in some cases, families said were related to abductions or forced conversions to Islam; security authorities occasionally assisted efforts to locate them. Shia community members again said that they risked accusations of blasphemy for publicly voicing religious opinions, praying in public, or owning books promoting Shia thought. There were reports that some public venues discriminated against women wearing hijabs. Al-Azhar faculty members generated backlash on social media by suggesting that women dress modestly and obey their husbands to avoid being the victims of violence and wife beating. In June, the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) announced the Coptic Orthodox Church had donated Saint Menas Church in Giza, near Cairo, for use as the ROC headquarters in Africa, reportedly prompting Pope and Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa Theodoros II to criticize Coptic Pope Tawadros II for interfering in Theodoros\u2019 \u201cdirect administrative and pastoral jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador and other embassy representatives met with government officials and religious leaders to underscore the importance of religious freedom and equal protection of all citizens before the law.

In these meetings, embassy officers emphasized the U.S. government\u2019s commitment to religious freedom and raised concerns, including prospective changes to the country\u2019s Personal Status Law, lack of legal recognition for religious minorities, reported harassment of religious converts, and the continued use of religious designations on national identity cards.

Following the October 2021 military takeover, authorities maintained laws put in place by the CLTG but ceased work on amendments. The Miscellaneous Amendments (Fundamental Rights and Freedoms) Act of 2020 (MAA) repealed the law criminalizing apostasy and amended the blasphemy law to apply to insults against any religion, rather than only Islam, although some criminal laws and practices established by the previous government led by Omar al-Bashir remained in effect. Some criminal laws and practices, addressed in low-level courts, continued to be based on the Bashir government\u2019s interpretation of a sharia system of jurisprudence which does not provide protections for some religious minorities, including minority Muslim groups.\n\nSeveral cases involving persons facing criminal charges for adultery or apostasy went to court during the year. In one case, authorities in Gezira State in October 2021 charged a married couple with adultery based on the Islamic prohibition of a Muslim woman marrying a Christian man. In addition to adultery, authorities charged the couple with violating marriage provisions of the law. According to the couple\u2019s lawyer, the pair could have been sentenced to 100 lashes, stoning, or \u201cinternal deportation or banishment\u201d if found guilty. The couple was scheduled to attend a hearing in October at al-Baqir Criminal Court in Gezira State. As of year\u2019s end, the couple had fled the country and was living abroad, and the hearing was not held.\n\nOn November 21, police arrested Pastor Abdulla Haroun Sulieman of the Sudan Presbyterian Evangelical Church in al-Hasahisa locality in Gezira State. According to a statement from the National Religious Freedoms Association, Pastor Sulieman was charged with witchcraft for leading a prayer meeting that allegedly healed his mother, who suffered from an infection. Local news reported on November 30 that \u201cMuslim extremists\u201d persuaded the police to arrest Pastor Sulieman for claiming to be a witch doctor. Police also arrested four men in Zalingei, Central Darfur State, who reportedly converted from Islam to Christianity. The four men were charged with apostasy, were jailed, and allegedly tortured. As of August 30, the Zalingei Prosecution Office in Central Darfur withdrew the case against the men.\n\nMedia outlets reported an individual attacked a Sudanese Church of Christ (SCOC) pastor and women at his congregation in al-Hajj Abdalla locality in Gezira State during a Palm Sunday service in April. Authorities charged both the pastor and the attacker with disturbing the peace, and they faced a one-month jail sentence. In February, media outlets reported that a court ordered the demolition of part of a church building in Omdurman belonging to the Sudan Presbyterian Evangelical Church (SPEC).\n\nU.S. embassy officials encouraged respect for religious freedom and the protection of minority religious groups and for the inclusion of religious freedom in the political framework agreement signed between the military and civilians in December. The framework agreement committed the State to support and protect freedom of belief and religious practices for all Sudanese and explained that the State will not impose specific religions on individuals. Embassy officials also urged local lower-level courts to adhere to the provisions of the 2019 constitutional declaration and the MAA. In addition, they urged government officials to abstain from the former regime\u2019s abuses of religious freedom, including punishments such as flogging and stoning for apostasy and adultery, and the confiscation and demolition of religious properties. Embassy officials maintained close contact with religious leaders, faith-based groups, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Embassy representatives monitored the state of religious freedom in the country and stressed the importance of religious tolerance among the various religious groups.",

The Ministry of Justice allows the practice of sharia as a special legal process outside the national civil code for Muslim residents of the \u201cDeep South\u201d \u2013 described as the four southernmost provinces near the Malaysian border, including three with a Muslim majority \u2013 for family law, including inheritance.\n\nAuthorities continued to use emergency decree and martial law provisions in effect in the Deep South that gave military, police, and civilian authorities powers to restrict certain basic rights, including extending pretrial detention and expanding warrantless searches. Authorities delegated certain internal security powers to the armed forces, often resulting in accusations by Muslims of unfair treatment, such as disproportionate searches of vehicles with Muslim passengers. The Muslim community in the Deep South continued to express frustration with perceived discriminatory treatment by security forces and what they described as a judicial system that lacked adequate checks and balances. According to the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Deep South Watch, through September, authorities had conducted 90 raid-and-search operations against Muslim insurgents.\n\nIn May, Muslim leaders objected to the transfer of a Buddhist district chief in Narathiwat Province from the district to Bangkok; religious leaders accused the chief of abuse of power and insulting Islam. Buddhist groups called for an investigation into the transfer, claiming the statements and actions by Muslim leaders against the district chief constituted discrimination against the Buddhist minority. During the year, media outlets and NGOs reported that several dozen Uyghur Muslims from China remained in immigrant detention centers, most of them detained since 2015. In a change from previous years, there were no reports that immigration authorities conducted raids to detain refugees (including those fleeing religious persecution) registered with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nThere were continued attacks against both Buddhists and Muslims in the Malay Muslim-majority Deep South, where religious and ethnic identity are closely linked in a longstanding separatist conflict. According to Deep South Watch, as of September 30, violence in the Deep South resulted in at least 88 deaths \u2013 among them 57 Muslims, 28 Buddhists, and three individuals with unidentified religious affiliation \u2013 compared with 86 deaths, including 59 Muslims, 26 Buddhists, and two with unidentified religious affiliation, in the same period in 2021. Authorities blamed insurgents for the August 17 coordinated bomb and arson attacks on convenience stores and gas stations at 17 locations in Yala, Narathiwat, and Pattani Provinces in the Deep South. One man was killed and at least seven injured in what was described as the biggest attack in the Deep South in four years. Authorities blamed Muslim insurgents for an August 15 attack in Su-ngai Padi District of Narathiwat Province, where a female Buddhist lost her legs in a landmine explosion and an August 3 attack in the same district where two Buddhist villagers were shot and killed.\n\nSome Buddhist groups continued to express frustration with perceived special allowances for Muslims. On September 20, the NGO Protect Buddhism for Peace requested the retail conglomerate owner of 7-11 minimarts stop selling halal branded products, arguing there were more Buddhists and Christians than Muslims in the country and that non-Muslims should not have to buy expensive Central Islamic Council of Thailand halal brands. Buddhist activists continued to campaign to designate Buddhism as the country\u2019s official religion.\n\nOn November 19, the U.S. Vice President met with Supreme Patriarch Somdej Phra Ariyavamsagatanana, the highest figure in Thai Buddhism, at Wat Ratchabophit and affirmed in U.S. respect for Buddhism. During the year, the Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires hosted an iftar for 32 prominent Muslim leaders to advance religious freedom, tolerance, and interfaith dialogue. U.S. embassy officials regularly met with religious leaders and scholars, international NGOs, academics, and representatives of faith-based organizations to discuss religious pluralism and tolerance as well as the plight of refugees fleeing religious violence. The Ambassador, and other embassy officials frequently visited religious sites of local significance and engaged in discussion with religious leaders on issues related to tolerance and diversity. The embassy awarded multiple grants to partners in the Deep South for projects focusing on diversity and inclusion, youth engagement, community building, and digital literacy/disinformation training. Embassy officials led quarterly virtual conversations with faith leaders, bringing together academics, religious leaders, community organizers, and youth influencers to create new connections, share perspectives on religious freedom issues, and consider future collaboration. In addition, the Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires visited the Deep South and hosted an iftar with local religious leaders and engaged university students in an interfaith community-building project.",

Rastafarians continued to press the government to fully legalize marijuana use for religious purposes. The Dominica Association of Evangelical Churches (DAEC) reported it continued to oppose homosexuality and to support the government\u2019s ban on same-sex marriages. The Dominican Christian Council, with the participation of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Methodist Churches, continued its opposition to a constitutional challenge seeking to overturn the country\u2019s law related to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex (LGBTQI+) conduct, which the Minority Rights Dominica (MiRiDom) and the HIV Legal Network filed on behalf of an unnamed claimant. The challenge remained in court at year\u2019s end.\n\nInterdenominational organizations continued their efforts to advance respect for religious freedom and diversity. Interdenominational dialogue between Catholic and Protestant communities continued on a regular basis.\n\nThe U.S. embassy continued its engagement on religious freedom issues. Embassy officials met during the year with the Ministry of Governance, Public Service Reform, Citizen Empowerment, and Social Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs.

On April 14, police arrested six Jewish activists on suspicion that they planned to sacrifice a goat during the Passover holiday at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount complex. Police also arrested several Jewish activists for blowing the Shofar horn at the Bab al-Rahma Muslim Cemetery. On May 29, tens of thousands of Jews participated in the \u201cFlags March,\u201d waving Israeli flags and walking through the Old City, including the Muslim Quarter, with marchers chanting insults about the Prophet Muhammad while clashing with Palestinians and police. Ultra-Orthodox protesters continued to attack and harass Jewish women who belong to the Women of the Wall group during their monthly service at the Western Wall. The Women of the Wall, whose members are mostly Reform and Conservative Jews, stated that their goal is to secure recognition for the right of women to wear prayer shawls and pray at the Western Wall. On at least one occasion, on June 30, ultra-Orthodox individuals went to a separate egalitarian section of the Western Wall and interrupted a bar mitzvah ceremony, calling the participants \u201cNazis,\u201d \u201cChristians,\u201d and \u201canimals.\u201d While the government said it was rare for any individual to be barred entry to the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, human rights and civil society organizations said authorities periodically banned individual Palestinian residents of the occupied territories West Bank and Gaza, as well as Arab/Palestinian and Jewish citizens of Israel, from the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount site. The government reiterated that non-Islamic prayer was not allowed on the grounds of the site but that non-Muslim visitors were allowed.\n\nThe Chief Rabbinate continued not to recognize as Jewish some Israeli citizens who self-identified as Jewish, including Reform and Conservative converts to Judaism and others who could not prove Jewish matrilineage to the satisfaction of the Chief Rabbinate. As a result, the government prohibited those individuals from accessing official Jewish marriage, divorce, and burial services in the country. Evangelical Christians and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, among others, were still not able to obtain official recognition as a religious group. Members of some religious minorities said the government did not provide the same services and benefits to them as to the country\u2019s majority Jewish population.\n\nOn February 7, unknown persons punctured the tires of 20 cars in Kfar Qasim and spraypainted a Star of David on them, writing, \u201cJewish wake up. Fight the enemy.\u201d During the year, unknown persons painted swastikas at sites in several cities, including Petah Tikva, Eilat, and Ashdod. In April, vandals painted a swastika on the sign of the Beit Tzur Baruch Synagogue in Ashdod. In some ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, private organizations posted \u201cmodesty signs\u201d demanding women dress modestly. Egged, the country\u2019s largest transit company, removed ads with images of women from its buses, with a company spokesman saying, \u201cImages [like these] cannot appear in advertisements, in consideration of children, teenagers, the religious [Jews], or Muslim Arabs.\u201d Christian clergy and pilgrims also continued to report that they were regularly harassed and spit upon by ultra-Orthodox Jews. Some Jews continued to oppose missionary activity directed at Jews as amounting to religious harassment and reacted with hostility toward Jewish converts to Christianity, such as Messianic Jews. Tension continued between the ultra-Orthodox community and other citizens, including concerns related to service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), housing, public transportation, participation in the workforce, and adherence to COVID-19 regulations. In its annual Israel Religion and State Index poll of 800 adult Jews conducted in July and published in September, the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Hiddush reported that 64 percent of respondents identified as either \u201csecular\u201d (47 percent) or \u201ctraditional \u2013 not-religious\u201d (17 percent) with regard to public policies on religion and the state, results that were consistent with its polling in recent years.\n\nIn meetings with government officials, the Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officials stressed the importance of religious pluralism and respect for all religious groups. Numerous high-level U.S. officials made formal stops at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust remembrance site, to remember the six million Jews and millions of others killed by the Nazis, underscore the importance of Holocaust education and countering Holocaust denial and disinformation, keep a public spotlight on antisemitism, and highlight religious tolerance. Senior U.S. officials spoke publicly about the importance of maintaining the historic status quo at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount and conveyed this message in meetings with government officials. Throughout the year, embassy officials used social media platforms to express U.S. support for tolerance and the importance of openness to members of other religious groups. Embassy-supported initiatives focused on interreligious dialogue and community development and advocated a shared society for Arab/Palestinian and Jewish populations of the country. The embassy also promoted a reduction of tensions between religious communities and an increase in interreligious communication and partnerships by bringing together representatives of many faith communities to advance shared goals and exchange knowledge and experience, and through engagements aimed at greater integration of the Arab/Palestinian minority into the broader national economy, especially the high-tech sector.\n\nThis section of the report covers Israel within the 1949 Armistice Agreement line as well as the Golan Heights and issues primarily related to Israeli residents of Jerusalem, territories that Israel occupied during the June 1967 war and where it later extended its domestic law, jurisdiction, and administration.

        "summary": "Reports on Hong Kong, Macau, Tibet, and Xinjiang are appended at the end of this report.\n\nThe constitution of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), which cites the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), states that citizens \u201cenjoy freedom of religious belief\u201d but limits protections for religious practice to \u201cnormal religious activities,\u201d without defining \u201cnormal.\u201d The government recognizes five official religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Protestantism, and Catholicism. Only religious groups belonging to one of the five state-sanctioned \u201cpatriotic religious associations\u201d representing these religions are permitted to register with the government and are officially permitted to hold worship services, although other groups reported meeting unofficially. Regulations require clergy to pledge allegiance to the CCP and socialism and to \u201cresist illegal religious activities and religious extremist ideology, and resist infiltration by foreign forces using religion.\u201d The law bans religious or spiritual groups that the government considers to be \u201ccults\u201d or to promote heterodox teachings. On March 1, laws came into effect banning unauthorized domestically generated online religious content and prohibiting overseas organizations and individuals from operating online religious information services in the country without a permit. On June 1, revised measures came into effect imposing greater CCP oversight of the financial management of religious groups and venues and regulating the handling of donations and real estate. CCP members and members of the armed forces are required to be atheists and are forbidden to engage in religious practices. National law prohibits organizations or individuals from interfering with the state educational system for minors, effectively barring individuals younger than 18 from participating in most religious activities or receiving religious education.\n\nThe government reportedly continued to assert control over religious groups and to restrict the activities and personal freedom of religious adherents it perceived as threatening state or CCP interests, according to religious groups, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and international media reports. NGOs and media continued to report deaths in custody and that the government tortured, physically abused, arrested, disappeared, detained, sentenced to prison, subjected to forced indoctrination in CCP ideology, and harassed adherents of both registered and unregistered religious groups for activities related to their religious beliefs and practices. Due to a lack of transparency regarding law enforcement\u2019s persecution of religious followers, estimates of those imprisoned during the year for their religious beliefs ranged from the low thousands to over 10,000. The NGO Human Rights without Frontiers estimated the government imprisoned 2,649 individuals for exercising their right to freedom of religion or belief as of year\u2019s end. The Dui Hua (Dialogue) Foundation\u2019s Political Prisoner Database counted 7,502 prisoners of conscience as of December 31, and said the most common charges were \u201corganizing or using a cult to undermine implementation of law,\u201d endangering state security, and inciting \u201csplittism,\u201d a charge often levied at ethnic minorities for taking part in religious, cultural, or pro-independence activities. According to Minghui, a Falun Gong-affiliated publication, authorities sentenced hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners from 28 provinces and regions for their faith to terms ranging from six months to 15 years in prison and harassed and arrested thousands of others. The Falun Dafa InfoCenter said authorities increased arrests and harassment in July and August in the run-up to the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (20th Party Congress) in an attempt to ensure \u201cstability\u201d for the congress. According to the annual report of The Church of Almighty God (CAG), during the year, authorities arrested thousands of its members and subjected some of them to forced indoctrination, physical abuse, including beatings, sleep deprivation, and being forced into stress positions, resulting in the death of at least 14 individuals. The NGO ChinaAid reported authorities detained and arrested house church members in Beijing during the Winter Olympics in February. Authorities prohibited religious festivals, closed religious venues, and raided worship services, in some cases citing COVID-19 prevention measures. NGOs reported the government continued to pressure unregistered religious groups to join the state-sanctioned patriotic religious associations or disband, subjecting their leaders to arrests and harassment.\n\nThe government continued its multiyear campaign of \u201cSinicization\u201d to bring all religious doctrine and practice in line with CCP doctrine, which included requiring clergy of all faiths to attend political indoctrination sessions and suggesting content for sermons that emphasized loyalty to the CCP and the state. In his October 16 speech to the 20th Party Congress, President and General Secretary Xi Jinping stated the CCP would \u201cremain committed to the principle that religions in China must be Chinese in orientation and provide active guidance to religions so that they can adapt to socialist society.\u201d The government continued its campaign against religious groups it characterized as \u201ccults,\u201d including the CAG and Falun Gong, and it conducted propaganda campaigns against xie jiao (literally \u201cheterodox teachings\u201d) aimed at school-age children. Human rights advocacy groups said the regime increasingly classified as xie jiao any group the CCP perceived as hostile to the regime, and courts increasingly applied anti-xie jiao punishments to groups that were not on the official list.\n\nThe government blocked religious websites and censored religious content from the popular messaging service WeChat. Authorities censored Mandarin- and Cantonese-language online posts referencing Jesus or the Bible, removed articles published by Christianity-related platforms, and removed the accounts or instructed internet service providers and individual users to remove accounts whose names contained the words \u201cgospel\u201d or \u201cChrist.\u201d The government prohibited unauthorized online broadcasts of religious services. One NGO said the new rules concerning online religious content essentially treated Christian religious material on the internet \u201con a par with pornography, drug dealing, and inciting rebellion.\u201d Authorities continued to restrict the printing and distribution of the Bible, the Quran, and other religious literature and penalized businesses that copied and published religious materials. There were reports authorities continued to remove \u201cArabic\u201d architectural features such as minarets from Hui mosques and other Muslim religious sites in Qinghai, Yunnan, Shanghai, and Beijing. NGOs reported that in June, riot police injured 20 Hui civilians protesting the demolition of the Baoshan Mosque in Zhaotong City, Yunnan Province.\n\nOn October 22, the Holy See announced that the 2018 provisional agreement between it and the government, which addressed the appointment of bishops, was again renewed for another two-year term until October 2024, although the text remained undisclosed. Nevertheless, the 2021 Administrative Measures for Religious Clergy issued by the State Administration of Religious Affairs (SARA) made no provision for the Holy See to have a role in the selection of Catholic bishops, and the government continued to harass, detain, disappear, and imprison many clergy who refused to join the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA), including some ordained by the Holy See. In November, the Holy See published a statement expressing \u201csurprise and regret\u201d that the government, without prior consultation, installed Monsignor John Peng Weizhao as \u201cauxiliary bishop of Jiangxi,\u201d a diocese that is not recognized by the Holy See.\n\nChristians, Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, and Falun Gong practitioners reported societal discrimination in employment, housing, and business opportunities.\n\nThe U.S. President, Secretary of State, Ambassador, and other senior State Department officials, and U.S. embassy and consulate general representatives issued public statements, including via social media, supporting religious freedom and condemning the PRC\u2019s abuses of the rights of religious minorities in the country, including in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang. On November 14, the White House in a statement announced that U.S. President raised concerns directly to President Xi regarding PRC \u201cpractices in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong, and human rights more broadly.\u201d The Ambassador and other embassy and consulate general officials met with a range of government officials to advocate for greater religious freedom and tolerance and for the release of individuals imprisoned for religious reasons. The Ambassador and other embassy and consulate general officials met with members of registered and unregistered religious groups, family members of religious prisoners, NGOs, and others to reinforce U.S. support for religious freedom. The embassy continued to amplify Department of State religious freedom initiatives and advocacy directly to Chinese citizens through outreach programs and social media.\n\nIn February, the United States declined to send diplomatic or official representation to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics due to concerns over what the presidential press secretary described as the government\u2019s \u201congoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses.\u201d On June 21, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act came into force, blocking products, goods, and materials originating in Xinjiang from entering the United States due to the risk that they were produced using forced labor. On March 21, the Secretary of State announced visa restrictions against certain unspecified government officials \u201cfor their involvement in repressive acts against members of ethnic and religious minority groups and religious and spiritual practitioners inside and outside of China\u2019s borders, including within the United States.\u201d On December 9, the Department of State announced sanctions and visa restrictions against three current and former officials for serious human rights abuses in Tibet, including serious violations of religious freedom, and for the arbitrary detention of Falun Gang practitioners in Chongqing.\n\nSince 1999, China has been designated as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom. On November 30, 2022, the Secretary of State redesignated China as a CPC and identified the following sanction that accompanied the designation: the existing ongoing restriction on exports to China of crime control and detection instruments and equipment, under the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-246), pursuant to section 402(c)(5) of the act.",

Any religious group seeking official recognition must obtain it through a multistep registration process with the Bureau of Worship (BOW), a unit within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The government has a special relationship with the Roman Catholic Church originating from an 1860 concordat between the government and the Holy See that affords the Catholic Church certain privileges. The concordat also accords the government the right of consent over the appointment of Catholic archbishops and bishops.\n\nAccording to the National Council of Haitian Muslims and the BOW, Sunni and Shia Muslim groups had not completed the procedures for registration and remained unregistered at year\u2019s end. While religious leaders representing the Catholic, Protestant, evangelical Protestant, Muslim, Vodou, and Jewish communities said the government did not restrict their religious freedom during the year, many religious leaders said the government\u2019s failure to maintain security and order hampered their communities\u2019 abilities to practice their religions freely. BOW Director General Evans Souffrant said promoting interreligious discussion and respect for religious freedom was his highest priority.\n\nMedia outlets reported armed gangs, kidnapping for ransom, and general insecurity impacted religious leaders and communities. During the year, gang members killed and kidnapped both clergy and lay persons. Examples included the killing by armed groups of an Italian nun on June 25 and of a police inspector while he attended church on July 24. On June 29, gang members reportedly killed six persons, including a Vodou priest, in P\u00e9tionville, while clashes between the 400 Mawozo and Kraze Bary\u00e9 gangs on October 10-16 in Croix-des-Bouquets resulted in the death of 10 persons, including artisans from Noailles, a village, known for its connections to Vodou. On May 2, in one of the many kidnappings reported during the year, gang members kidnapped Pastor Alcero Marc Arthur in P\u00e9tionville and released him on May 4 after the gang received ransom payments. Leaders from all major religious communities said the killings and kidnappings were part of a wider trend of rising gang violence. According to religious leaders, gangs were motivated by financial gain rather than religious discrimination. They said religious leaders holding a prominent position in society were likely to have access to personal funds and wealthy foreign donors.\n\nVodou leaders reported Vodouists continued to face stigma from other religious groups, who they said described Vodou as contrary to Christianity. Some Vodou leaders also expressed optimism about increased societal tolerance and acceptance of Vodou, which is a government-recognized religion.\n\nU.S. embassy officials engaged Souffrant on issues of religious freedom, including the importance of respecting religious diversity. Embassy officials held regular conversations with government officials and Catholic, Muslim, Protestant, evangelical Christian, and Vodou religious leaders to discuss the state of religious freedom and challenges religious groups faced. Religious leaders were also a key component of embassy engagement with civil society organizations. In March, the Assistant Secretary of State for Conflict and Stabilization Operations engaged religious leaders as part of her civil society consultations. Religious leaders were an integral part of the development of the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability throughout the year, in part because gangs often targeted members of religious groups. During the holiday season in December, the embassy used social media to share statements supporting religious freedom.",

According to SEGOB, during the year, DGAR investigated five cases related to religious freedom, the same number as in 2021. During the year, the National Council to Prevent Discrimination (CONAPRED) opened two religious discrimination cases, compared with three in 2021. In May, CONAPRED worked with the Jewish community to denounce a Nazi-themed wedding held at a Catholic church and urged the Episcopal Conference of Mexico (CEM), which represents the Catholic Church in the country, to instruct Catholic bishops to prohibit antisemitic or discriminatory symbology. In April, local government authorities threatened a pastor and three Protestant families who did not participate in Catholic festivities in the state of Guerrero, forcing the families to relocate to another location in the state. DGAR registered 149 new religious associations during the year, compared with 61 in 2021.\n\nDuring the year, there were three reported killings of priests as well as multiple attacks on, threats against, and abductions of, priests and pastors. Government officials and leaders within the Catholic Church continued to state that the attacks reflected high levels of generalized violence throughout the country and were not based on religion. The nongovernmental organization (NGO) Catholic Multimedia Center (CMC) reported 800 incidents of extortion and threats against priests nationwide between October 2021 and October 2022. CMC reported it accounted for approximately 850 reports yearly for the past five years. According to CMC, the number was likely underestimated because it did not include digital extortion cases, which priests said have increased since 2020. Religious leaders were often involved in politics and social activism and were thus more vulnerable to generalized violence. Incidents of violence against religious leaders did not appear to be based solely on religious identity. The CMC identified Mexico as the most violent country for priests in Latin America for the 14th consecutive year, reporting killings of more than 39 priests over the past decade. Some NGOs said criminal groups continued to single out Catholic priests and other religious leaders because of their condemnation of criminal activities and because communities viewed them as moral authority figures.\n\nU.S. embassy and consulate general representatives at all levels met regularly with government officials responsible for religious and Indigenous affairs at both federal and state levels. The Ambassador met with Indigenous leaders, including Catholic community representatives called mayordomos, who exercise religious, political, and cultural influence at the local level, to discuss freedom of expression and religious freedom. Embassy representatives met with members of religious groups and faith-based organizations, including the Central Jewish Committee, CMC, and CSW (formerly known as Christian Solidarity Worldwide), focusing on the safety of religious workers, humanitarian issues, and expressing support for religious tolerance. The embassy published several social media posts commemorating religious freedom, including U.S. condemnation of religious freedom violations, celebration of interfaith unity, and commemoration of victims persecuted for their religious beliefs.",

        "summary": "The constitution provides for freedom of religious belief and affiliation and states the country is not bound to any particular faith. Registration requirements for religious groups include the need to present a petition with signatures of at least 50,000 adherents. A group lacking the minimum 50,000 adult adherents required to obtain status as an official religious group may register as a civic association to function; in doing so, however, it may not identify itself officially as a religious group.\n\nGroups that were unable to meet the minimum threshold of adherents to be registered as religious groups continued to consider this requirement discriminatory. In response to discrimination motions filed by one small unregistered religious group, the Public Defender of Rights (ombudsperson) stated in March that the registration requirements were unreasonable, discriminatory, and unnecessary, while the Slovak National Center for Human Rights stated they were in breach of the constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. The Ministry of Culture refused to initiate a legal change. State authorities continued to prosecute some members of the Kotlebovci \u2013 Ludova strana Nase Slovensko (Kotleba\u2019s \u2013 People\u2019s Party Our Slovakia) (LSNS) and Republika parties for defaming minority religious beliefs and denying the Holocaust. In April, the Supreme Court confirmed a guilty verdict against LSNS party chairperson and Member of Parliament (MP) Marian Kotleba for an act of antisemitism and sentenced him to a six-month suspended sentence and 18 months of probation, causing the Kotleba to automatically lose his parliamentary seat. In response to calls by representatives of the ruling coalition to dissolve the LSNS party, stating Kotleba\u2019s conviction was proof of the extremist and unconstitutional nature of the party itself, Prosecutor General Maros Zilinka announced in August that he would not attempt to ban the party.\n\nIn February, the Constitutional Court ruled the Public Health Authority could require citizens to present proof of COVID-19 vaccination, recovery from the virus, or a negative COVID-19 test to access facilities and public events, including religious services. The government gradually eliminated these restrictions, which some political and religious stakeholders had previously criticized for violating the right to freedom of religion. The Muslim community, which was registered as a civic association, continued to state the lack of recognition as a religious group made obtaining burial spaces and the necessary construction permits for worship sites difficult. Government officials and MPs from both the government coalition and opposition parties continued to make anti-Muslim statements. Following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February, several politicians engaged in rhetoric portraying third-country refugees fleeing Ukraine, particularly from \u201cArab and African countries,\u201d as a security threat. In March, parliament adopted a resolution formally condemning the deportations of Slovak Jews to Nazi concentration camps by the Slovak fascist state and apologizing to the members of the Jewish community. Antisemitism experts criticized Obycajni ludia a nezavisle osobnosti (Ordinary People and Independent Personalities) (OLaNO) party leader and Finance Minister Igor Matovic for trivializing the Holocaust by repeatedly comparing media criticism of himself to scapegoating of the Jewish population in the 1930s.\n\nIn October, a man driven by antisemitic conspiracy theories and hatred towards religious, sexual, and racial minorities shot and killed two persons and injured another in front of a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+)-friendly bar in the center of Bratislava before killing himself. In the aftermath of the attack, civil society and political leaders across the board denounced hate-motivated violence and called for an end to hateful rhetoric in the public domain. In January, a man wearing a jacket with an antireligious inscription struck a priest during a New Year Mass at a Greek Catholic church in Bardejov. Unregistered religious groups said the public tended to distrust them and perceive them as \u201cfringe cults\u201d because of their lack of official government recognition. The Muslim community continued to report anti-Muslim hate speech on social media, which it mostly attributed to inflammatory public statements by politicians and negative portrayals of Islam and Muslims in the media. The Islamic Foundation in Slovakia reported that 70 percent of media coverage of Islam and Muslims was negative. According to surveys by local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), a majority of Slovaks disapproved of having Muslim neighbors and almost 25 percent believed that no Muslims should have the right to settle in the country. Organizations that media described as far right continued to publish material on and to commemorate the World War II-era, Nazi-allied Slovak state, and to praise its leaders.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador, Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires, and other U.S. embassy officers raised with government officials the treatment of religious minorities and the difficulties those groups faced regarding registration, as well as the need for measures to counter what religious groups and others described as widespread antisemitism and anti-Muslim sentiment. The Ambassador, Charg\u00e9, and other embassy officers also repeatedly used private and public events, as well as social media, to highlight the importance of religious freedom and tolerance in society and the importance of countering hate speech and violence towards religious, sexual, and ethnic minorities. Embassy officials, including the Ambassador, met regularly with registered and unregistered religious organizations and NGOs to raise the issue of hate speech and to highlight the role of churches and religious groups in countering extremism and promoting tolerance.",

The law criminalizes blasphemy but not apostasy. Proselytizing to Muslims by non-Muslims is a crime.\n\nIn October, Ahmadi Muslim community leaders said 33 Ahmadi Muslims were defendants in the court system on charges including blasphemy, holding unauthorized gatherings, and illegal fundraising, a decline from an estimated 50 defendants in February 2021, and 220 in October 2020. In March, a court sentenced the president of the Protestant Church of Algeria (EPA), Pastor Salaheddine Chalah, to 18 months in prison for proselytizing on social media, practicing non-Muslim religious rites without authorization, and \u201cinciting an unarmed gathering,\u201d the charge for unauthorized protests. An appeals court later reduced the sentence to a six-month suspended sentence and a fine. Four members of the Ahmadi Muslim community remained in prison during the year on charges of blasphemy, holding unauthorized gatherings, and illegally fundraising. In September, authorities charged Christian convert Slimane Bouhafs with offenses that included offense against the Prophet Muhammad, publication of false news, and inciting hatred and racial discrimination. In April 2021, a court sentenced Said Djabelkheir, a well-known Muslim Sufi scholar, to three years in prison for \u201coffenses to Islam.\u201d Djabelkheir wrote that the sacrifice of sheep predated Islam and denounced child marriage. At the end of the year, an appeal of his sentence was still pending.\n\nSeveral religious groups, including the Ahmadi Muslim community and the EPA, said the government had yet to accept their registration applications. Both groups have made several attempts to register since 2012. According to EPA and civil society leaders, authorities continued to arrest, jail, and fine EPA members on charges of proselytizing. In September, the EPA reported the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MRA) slowed its import of Bibles. EPA leaders said the government closed eight churches during the year, bringing the total to 36 EPA-affiliated churches closed since 2017. According to media reports, there are 11 EPA churches remaining in the country. Catholic, Anglican, and Methodist groups said the government sometimes did not respond to their requests for foreign religious workers\u2019 visas, resulting in de facto visa refusals.\n\nSome Christian leaders and congregants stated that non-Muslims faced social pressure for practicing a non-Muslim faith. Some individuals who engaged in religious practice other than Sunni Islam reported they had experienced threats and intolerance. Some local media outlets occasionally criticized Ahmadi Islam and Shia Islam as \u201csects\u201d or \u201cdeviations\u201d from Islam or as \u201cforeign\u201d and demonstrated a bias against these groups. Ahmadi leaders said news outlets continued to amplify what they considered government misinformation portraying Ahmadis as violent.\n\nThe Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officers frequently met with senior government officials in the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Religious Affairs, Justice, and Interior to discuss religious tolerance and respect and religious freedom, including the difficulties Ahmadis, Christians, and other minority religious groups faced in registering as associations, importing religious materials, and obtaining visas. The Ambassador routinely visited religious institutions and met with faith communities during her travels throughout the country. The Ambassador and other embassy officers focused on pluralism and religious tolerance and respect in meetings with leaders from both Sunni Muslim and minority religious groups as well as with other members of the public. The embassy used special events, social media, and speakers\u2019 programs to emphasize messages of religious respect and tolerance.\n\nOn November 30, 2022, in accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as amended, the Secretary of State placed Algeria on the Special Watch List for having engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom.",

The constitution declares the country a secular state and provides for the separation of religious institutions and the state, but the Cuban Communist Party (CCP), through its Office of Religious Affairs (ORA) and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), regulates religious practice. The law requires all religious groups to apply to the MOJ for official registration. According to the penal code, membership in or association with an unregistered group is a crime. An amendment to an existing law, in effect since December 1, increases the minimum sentencing for individuals who attempt to conscientiously object to military service or public schooling, including those whose objections are based on their religious beliefs. An additional law, also in effect since December, imposes sentences of up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment on persons receiving funding from foreign organizations or for financing activities considered to be directed against the state or its constitutional order, a law that could target independent civil society, including religious groups.\n\nIn its annual Watch List, the Christian nongovernmental organization (NGO) Open Doors reported the government intensified its repressive tactics against Christian leaders and activists opposing CCP ideology through arrests, exile, arbitrary fines, surveillance, denials of licenses and religious visas, and physical and mental abuse. According to CSW, formerly known as Christian Solidarity Worldwide, the government continued to detain religious leaders from multiple faith communities and handed down harsh prison sentences for participating in July 2021 protests. In May, the government informed the family of Pastor Lorenzo Rosales Fajardo that a court had sentenced him to seven years in prison on charges of disrespect, assault, criminal incitement, and public disorder. In March, a court sentenced Donaida P\u00e9rez Paseiro, President of the faith-based Association of Free Yorubas of Cuba (Free Yorubas), to eight years in prison, and Vice President Loreto Hern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda to seven years. Beginning in January, security officials detained and fined Ladies in White leader Berta Soler Fern\u00e1ndez and other members every Sunday as they attempted to attend Mass to pray for the freedom of political prisoners. Authorities imposed prison sentences of between five and eight years on several Ladies in White members, including an additional five years for a member who was weeks from completing a four-year prison sentence. Reportedly, the government increasingly pressured critics into forced exile, including religious leaders. In March, the government forced Pastor Jes\u00fas Fundora P\u00e9rez of the Apostolic Movement to leave the country, reportedly threatening to charge him with sedition and criminal incitement if he remained. In June, authorities summoned Pastor Alain Toledano Valiente and gave him 30 days to permanently leave the country or \u201csuffer the consequences.\u201d In July, Toledano went into exile with his family. In September, the government refused to renew the residency permit of Superior of the Jesuits in Cuba, Father David Pantale\u00f3n, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, because he criticized the government\u2019s abuse of human rights. According to Outreach Aid to the Americas (OAA), 52 of 56 faith leaders surveyed on the island said the government took repressive measures against them; 21 reported being subjected to threats, violence, detentions, and acts of repudiation. Religious groups said the ORA and the MOJ continued to deny official registration to certain religious groups or did not respond to long-pending applications, such as those for Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Church of Jesus Christ).\n\nSome religious groups and organizations, such as the Roman Catholic charity Caritas, continued to gather and distribute relief items, providing humanitarian assistance to individuals regardless of religious belief.\n\nU.S. embassy officials did not meet with or otherwise engage the ORA during the year. In public statements and on social media, U.S. government officials, including the Secretary of State, continued to call upon the government to respect the fundamental freedoms of its citizens, including the freedom of religion. Embassy officials met regularly with a range of religious groups concerning the state of religious freedom and political activities related to religious groups\u2019 beliefs.\n\nOn November 30, 2022, in accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as amended, the Secretary of State designated Cuba a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom.",

They also convicted a former army officer found with Nazi and other antisemitic materials, firearms, and explosives in his home of planning attacks against senior officials and a Jewish human rights activist. Federal and state domestic intelligence services continued to monitor the activities of numerous Muslim groups and mosques with ties to Islamist groups, and the Church of Scientology (COS).

Certain states continued to ban or restrict the use of religious clothing or symbols by some state employees. The federal Military Rabbinate expanded from one to three chaplains, but the Ministry of Defense, citing continuing obstacles, had still not appointed any imams as chaplains.

Ahmadi Muslims said officials and judges in asylum proceedings often expressed skepticism about Ahmadi individuals\u2019 professions of faith or disregarded concerns that they could not practice their faith openly in their homeland.\n\nSeveral states initiated programs to educate the public about antisemitism and set up mechanisms for victims to report incidents of antisemitism.

Preliminary Ministry of Interior crime statistics for 2022 cited 2,639 antisemitic crimes, a 12.8 percent decrease from 2021. Of the antisemitic crimes, 88 involved violence, a 37.5 percent increase over 2021. The ministry registered 662 anti-Muslim and 109 anti-Christian crimes in 2021 (the latest year for which such figures were available), a decrease of 28.7 percent and 22.7 percent, respectively, from the previous year. It classified most perpetrators of anti-Muslim crimes as right-wing extremists but indicated that perpetrators of crimes against Christians came from different camps.\n\nA poll released in May showed that more than half of the country\u2019s population believed antisemitism was a widespread and worsening problem. A plurality blamed right-wing extremists for spreading antisemitism, although Muslim respondents were more likely to blame anti-Israel sentiment than the general population. There were multiple cases during the year of assaults against Muslim women wearing headscarves; according to a report commissioned by the Berlin state government, there was \u201cvirulent\u201d discrimination in the state\u2019s public agencies against women who wore headscarves.

Religious rights groups reported instances in which police continued to prohibit, impede, or attempt to close Christian and Muslim places of worship, citing government regulations. In April, the government widened the scope of regulations requiring approval for construction of places of worship. Critics said the government used the regulations to unfairly target minority religious groups. Media outlets, ethnic minority groups, and opposition politicians continued to report that the Department of Archaeology and the Presidential Task Force for Archaeological Heritage Management in the Eastern Province identified Buddhist heritage in sites that were traditionally Muslim or Hindu, then designated the sites for conservation or construction of Buddhist structures.

The United Nations documented that from April to September, Christians were the most targeted ethnoreligious minority, followed by Muslims. Anti-Christian posts accused Christians of co-opting the country-wide protest movement.

Antisemitic literature continued to be available online from informal sellers. Smaller religious groups, mainly Protestant and considered \u201cnontraditional\u201d by the government, again stated they encountered continued public distrust and misunderstanding. They said that some websites, traditional media, and members of the public often branded small religious groups as \u201csects,\u201d a term with a strong negative connotation in Serbian.\n\nU.S. embassy officials engaged with a variety of government ministries and offices to advocate for religious freedom and tolerance, continued interfaith dialogue, and the protection of religious sites throughout the country. The embassy continued to encourage the accurate presentation of history at the planned Holocaust memorial center in Belgrade and emphasized the importance of continued restitution of Holocaust-era heirless and unclaimed Jewish property. Embassy officials met with representatives from a wide range of religious groups, including the SOC, Roman Catholic Church, Islamic communities, Jewish community, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and Christian Baptist Church, to discuss issues of religious freedom and tolerance, the religious groups\u2019 engagement with the government and one another, and property restitution.",

There were also reports of discrimination against Muslim women wearing religious attire in public and private employment. The government again failed to implement a 2016 Constitutional Court decision recognizing SOC ownership of land around the Visoki Decani Monastery.

The criminal code effectively prohibits conversion from Islam, according to scholars and human rights advocates.\n\nBetween November 2021 and March 2022, the Tripoli-based Internal Security Agency (ISA), closely aligned with Government of National Unity (GNU) Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dabaiba, arrested several young activists and subjected them to intimidation, harassment, forced confessions, and torture. According to Amnesty International, the ISA posted videos of seven men \u201c\u2018confessing\u2019 under apparent duress and communicating with atheists, agnostics, Quaranists, feminists, and secularists both online and in person.\u201d\n\nAccording to press and social media reports, the Special Deterrence Forces (SDF or Rada), a Salafist armed group that reports to the Presidential Council in Tripoli, continued to enforce Islamic law in some parts of the capital and, according to human rights activists, arrest and detain individuals whom it suspected of violating Islamic law. Following a February 15 hearing, a court ordered the Union Church of Tripoli, a Christian congregation, to vacate its building or face forcible eviction. The church had used the building as its house of worship for over 50 years, having moved there after the government expropriated its building. After receiving initial permission to dock in Libyan ports, local governments withdrew their approvals for port calls by the MV Logos Hope, a ship operated by a German faith-based organization whose website describes it as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest floating bookfair.\u201d The local government withdrawal of permission to make port calls followed an outcry by prominent individual Muslims and Islamic organizations, who said that the mission of the ship was Christian proselytism.\n\nSome areas of the country, including the eastern part, operated under the influence of the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) and LNA-affiliated armed groups. Nonstate actors and militias continued to operate and control territory throughout the country, including in parts of Tripoli and in Benghazi, where there were reports of armed groups restricting religious practices, enforcing compliance with sharia according to their interpretation, and targeting those viewed as violating their standards. An armed group affiliated with the LNA destroyed a church in the southern city of Sebha, in what local leaders claimed was an operation against smuggling and trafficking but provided no compensation for the destruction. According to media reports, elements of the Madkhali Salafist movement affiliated with the LNA continued to crack down on activities not sanctioned by their strict interpretation of Islam, including the sale of books deemed un-Islamic and events where men and women mixed. Multiple contacts reported that, as in previous years, Sufis were able to practice more openly in the western part of the country compared with previous years, and Libyans engaged in public Sufi religious celebrations in Tripoli and Zliten.\n\nAccording to Christian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) such as Middle East Concern (MEC), Open Doors USA, and The Voice of the Martyrs, Muslims who converted to another religion faced intense social and economic pressure to renounce their faith and return to Islam. Sources also reported converts to other religions, as well as atheists and agnostics, faced threats of violence or dismissal from employment and hostility from their families and communities because of their beliefs. According to the World Organization of the Jews of Libya, authorities continued conversion of an abandoned synagogue in Tripoli into an Islamic religious center without permission.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy to Libya operated from Tunis, Tunisia, while U.S. diplomats made infrequent, short-duration trips to the country.

The embassy funded a program to counter disinformation and hate speech in the country, including religious hate speech. The program included an online campaign that had reached 208,000 followers by October. The embassy also partnered with local and international NGOs to implement media literacy training and social media campaigns aimed at curbing hate speech and disinformation. The U.S. government supported international efforts to establish a unified, stable, democratic, and tolerant Libyan state, and continued to raise issues of religious freedom in conversations with authorities, NGOs, academics, and other human rights advocates.",

In July, vandalism at a Catholic church in a majority-Muslim town created tension between Catholics and Muslims. Catholics criticized President Sissoco for reportedly downplaying the incident. The government continued its policy of not providing free food to Muslims during Ramadan. The government also temporarily cut tax exemptions for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and religious groups as part of an overall review of tax and customs exemptions. The government attempted to restrict the transmission of a church\u2019s radio broadcast that other religious communities had accused of promoting division and intolerance.\n\nReligious leaders in the country agreed that different ethnic and religious groups were mostly respectful and tolerant of one another throughout the country. Representatives from Islamic, Catholic, and Evangelical communities gathered for an inaugural two-day conference and produced a common agenda of religious leaders for the promotion of peace and prevention of radicalism and violent extremism in the country. The agenda included provisions to create a platform for dialogue and to institutionalize an annual day of inter-religious reflection to promote peace.

Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses reported no new instances of conscientious objectors from that group being detained or imprisoned during the year. According to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and government sources, no members of any religious community remained in prison for conscientious objection following the government\u2019s amnesty and release of prisoners for Ramadan in 2021.

Most minority religious leaders reported no cases of harassment by government security services during the year, which they said was a significant change from previous years. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses reported 25 instances of law enforcement personnel summoning members to law enforcement offices or interrogating them about their faith at their places of work. Opposition-affiliated media highlighted cases of government harassment of religious groups.

Leaders of minority religious groups reported improvements in the religious freedom climate in the country over the last year, including better relations with government officials, fewer barriers to registration, easier access to digital religious literature, the alternative for required national service, and more assistance providing places for worship.\n\nMinority religious groups said persons who were not Sunni Muslim or Russian Orthodox continued to report harassment, such as public shaming by family members, friends, and neighbors. Some religious leaders stated that the government\u2019s suspicion of religion continued to be mirrored by private sector employers, and that membership in a minority religious organization or even \u201cexcessive\u201d expressions of religiosity \u2013 including by members of the dominant Sunni Muslim community \u2013 could result in the loss of employment opportunities and frequently triggered harassment. According to Christian community leaders, Muslims who converted to Christianity faced pressure from families, friends, and local communities to return to their former faith.\n\nIn meetings and official correspondence with government officials, the Ambassador, other U.S. embassy representatives, and other U.S. government officials expressed concern about some religious freedom issues, including the legal status of conscientious objectors, the registration process, and other factors that had contributed to Turkmenistan\u2019s designation as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. Embassy representatives advocated for an official announcement of an internationally recognized alternative service for conscientious objectors and urged the government to continue to refrain from arresting, detaining, or harassing religious practitioners. During June and September roundtables hosted by the Ambassador, leaders of 10 minority religious groups discussed religious freedom challenges in the country. Throughout the year, the Ambassador and other embassy officials visited places of worship of minority religious groups, including a Christian Orthodox church, a Baha\u2019i worship center, and a Sunni mosque, to show support for those communities and provide a forum to discuss their concerns.\n\nSince 2014, Turkmenistan has been designated as a CPC for having engaged in or tolerated \u201cparticularly severe violations of religious freedom.\u201d On November 30, 2022, the Secretary of State again designated Turkmenistan as a CPC and announced a waiver of the sanctions that accompany designation as required in the \u201cimportant national interest of the United States.\u201d",

In October, President Yoweri Museveni signed into law the Computer Misuse Amendment Act 2022, which criminalizes as hate speech forms of expression that \u201cridicule, degrade, or demean\u201d individuals based on their religion.\n\nMembers of the Muslim community stated that security agencies unfairly singled out Muslims for arrest and detention while enforcing antiterrorism operations. Prominent members of the community accused the government of detaining Muslim leaders without trial for terrorism-related offences. The Minister of Internal Affairs stated in August that he instructed security agencies to cease making arrests without adequate investigations. Evangelical leaders reported that government officials closed evangelical churches in remote areas that failed to comply with registration requirements. Evangelical ministers also stated that government officials in the capital, Kampala, threatened to expel evangelical street preachers from the city. The Uganda Muslim Supreme Council (UMSC) reported that the government discriminated against Muslims in its education policies by declining to recognize the curriculum in Muslim seminaries and by appointing Christian teachers to lead Muslim public schools. The government made financial and material donations to the Roman Catholic, Anglican, and evangelical churches, as well as Muslim communities.\n\nThe UMSC and Muslim civil society groups reported that elite Christian schools and universities discriminated against Muslim students in their admissions. Christian members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) community reported that most Christian ministers in evangelical, Catholic, and Anglican churches openly condemned the community, coerced LGBTQI+ members to endure so-called conversion therapy, barred them from openly expressing themselves, and in some cases barred them from attending religious activities.\n\nU.S. embassy representatives regularly discussed religious freedom issues with government officials. The Ambassador met on several occasions with President Museveni and emphasized the government\u2019s obligations to respect the rights of all persons, regardless of religious affiliation. At the start of Ramadan on April 1, the embassy used its social media platforms to promote religious tolerance, charity, and unity and communicate greetings from the Secretary of State and the Ambassador. On April 13, the Ambassador hosted an iftar and highlighted the importance of peace, justice, compassion, tolerance, and commitment to family and community. The embassy also facilitated an April 25 iftar for former participants of U.S. exchange programs that was organized by an alumna who uses arts to address violent extremism, gender-based violence, and other community challenges.

Authorities subsequently rearrested him, and at year\u2019s end he remained imprisoned in Filingu\u00e9 prison.\n\nThe government did not achieve its stated intent to fully implement the 2019 National Worship Strategy by the end of the year due to resource and capacity constraints. The government provided guidance on sermons and encouraged preachers to focus on promoting national unity, brotherhood, and peaceful coexistence in their sermons, through the media, or in public places such as market stalls or occasional ceremonies.\n\nThe government faced a series of persistent and growing security threats from the group alternatively known as the \u201cIslamic State in West Africa\u201d or \u201cthe Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province,\u201d as well as from Boko Haram, a terrorist organization based in northeastern Nigeria and active in southeastern Niger\u2019s Lake Chad region. On March 7 and 8, Boko Haram attacked and killed 20 villagers in the country\u2019s eastern Diffa region. Media reported numerous terrorist attacks during the year. Security threats include continued deadly attacks in the country\u2019s Tillab\u00e9ri Region. In response, the government launched air strikes in Tamou, a gold-mining town in the Tillab\u00e9ri Region, that killed dozens of civilians. The government stated that the casualties were terrorists, but the Panafrican Network for Peace, Democracy, and Development (REPPAD), a human rights nongovernmental organization (NGO), conducted an independent investigation and released a report that stated the casualties were civilians. In response to REPPAD\u2019s report, authorities arrested the coordinator of REPPAD and detained him for several weeks before releasing him.\n\nChristian groups active in the country included missions, associations, movements, and NGOs. The Interfaith Dialogue Organization, with both Muslim and Christian members, continued to meet in committees in all eight regions of the country and in local committees in 140 communes of the country. The organization also conducted a series of workshops for Muslim and Christian religious leaders and students on the theme of \u201cPeaceful Coexistence in the Quran and the Bible.\u201d\n\nThe Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires and other U.S. embassy representatives conveyed messages of religious tolerance in meetings with Muslim and Christian representatives. The Charg\u00e9 spoke with a prominent imam and the Catholic Archbishop at the embassy\u2019s Fourth of July celebration. The Charg\u00e9 also met with the Imam of Niamey to express solidarity with the country\u2019s Muslims on Eid al-Fitr.

end, the Houthis continued to imprison Jewish Yemeni citizen Levi Salem Musa Marhabi, whom they have held since 2016 and despite a 2019 order by a Houthi \u201ccourt\u201d that he be released.\u00a0 According to the NGO Insaf, Houthi officials tortured Marhabi during his detention, leaving him partially paralyzed.\u00a0 The UN special rapporteur said the Houthis practiced systematic discrimination against members of the Baha\u2019i community, arresting and deporting them, raiding their gatherings, seizing their properties, and denying them employment opportunities.\u00a0 According to ACLED, the Houthis targeted Christian converts through \u201cjudicial harassment on charges of apostasy\u201d as well as other extrajudicial means such as threats and assaults.\u00a0 They imposed ideologically driven constraints on women\u2019s freedom of movement and access to employment, education, and health care.\u00a0 According to the UN special rapporteur, the Houthis spread \u201chateful rhetoric\u201d against religious minorities in the educational curriculum.\u00a0 According to Open Doors, Christians and other religious minorities were the most vulnerable in Houthi-controlled areas in the north and rural areas in the south, where there was a strong al-Qa\u2019ida presence and where ISIS-Yemen (ISIS-Y) also targeted Christians.\n\nOpen Doors said pressure on Christians in all spheres of life, including education, employment, family life, and the ability to observer religious practices, was \u201cat extreme levels.\u201d\u00a0 Converts faced death threats and risked banishment from their tribes if they did not return to Islam.\u00a0 Open Doors reported Muslim humanitarian aid providers denied assistance to religious minorities.\n\nThe Department of State suspended U.S. embassy operations in Sana\u2019a in 2015, and U.S. diplomatic operations regarding Yemen have since been coordinated by the Yemen Affairs Unit (YAU) based in Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 Due to security concerns arising from the conflict, the U.S. government had limited to no access to religious communities in the country during the year.\u00a0 The YAU continued to closely monitor the conditions of religious minority detainees and to press for their release, maintain communication with religious contacts among the Yemeni diaspora communities, and promote religious freedom through social media.\u00a0 The U.S. Ambassador to Yemen and the U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen spoke with foreign government officials, civil society organizations, and religious leaders during the year regarding Marhabi\u2019s ongoing detention.\n\nOn November 30, 2022, the Secretary of State designated the Houthis as an \u201centity of particular concern\u201d under section 301 of the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-281) for having engaged in particularly severe violations of religious freedom.\n\n",

A government directive restricts monks from participating in political protests and requires them to be politically neutral.\n\nOn December 22, authorities sentenced former Buddhist monk Voeung Samnang to five years in prison for conspiracy to commit treason and incitement to commit a felony or cause social unrest for posting messages critical of Prime Minister Hun Sen to social media. As of year\u2019s end, the Ministry of Cults and Religions (MCR) had not publicly released a draft law reportedly criminalizing \u201creligious people\u201d who participate in political acts, including \u201corganized activity against any political party.\u201d In February, the Prime Minister announced a campaign to appoint more Muslims to leadership roles in local governments serving significant Muslim populations, leading to the appointment of 12 deputy provincial governors and 32 deputy district chiefs across the country. Slow government registration of communal land grants hindered the ability of some Indigenous communities to protect forest land they considered sacred. The government continued to deny refugee status to 12 Christian Montagnards from Vietnam, despite an outstanding request from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In July and August, the leader of a doomsday cult called thousands of followers, including some from abroad, to his farm in Siem Reap to await a cataclysmic flood.

By law, the government gives financial support to four of these faith communities, but not to VUSH or other religious groups.\n\nIn May, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses filed a court appeal, pending at year\u2019s end, against what it said was the government\u2019s failure to respond to repeated requests for an agreement similar to those obtained by the five faith communities, which left the group subject to certain tariffs. In July, Imam Ahmed Kalaja of Tirana\u2019s Dine Hoxha Mosque reported to authorities that a police officer was intimidating members of the mosque. An evangelical Christian pastor filed a legal suit, pending at year\u2019s end, challenging a 2021 finding that he was guilty of hate speech for comments he had made against proposed amendments pertaining to same-sex unions. The five religious communities with agreements with the government continued to express concern over delayed restitution of property seized under the former communist regime. The State Agency of the Cadaster (SAC) reported problems returning property to religious communities, stating that this was mainly because properties were occupied with other legally and illegally constructed buildings, and it said in-kind compensation was limited by insufficient available property. The Bektashi community, AOC, and AMC again reported problems defending their titles to some properties. The government legalized 97 buildings owned by religious groups that had been built without construction permits, compared with 104 in 2021; 28 additional properties remained under review.

Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses said there was some negative media coverage of the group, which they said stemmed from its lack of status as an officially recognized religious organization.

Minority religious groups said they were able to worship in private spaces without government interference provided they did not disturb their neighbors or violate laws regarding assembly and restrictions on proselytizing. Most minority religious groups reported a continued lack of facilities for worship and difficulty obtaining permission to construct new ones, as well as problems obtaining sufficient visas for clergy or visiting staff. The government did not accredit any religious schools or permit Shia religious training in the country. Shia leaders continued to report discrimination in clerical and public sector employment.

Despite the perception that many Shia were often viewed as being lower on the social scale and marginalized in religious, economic, social, and political terms, Shia community members noted that many Shia families were very successful and wealthy merchants. Antisemitic stereotypes occasionally appeared in the media, as did statements critical of some Islamic views. In one case, a television personality in a YouTube video said that American Jews were politically influential because they were \u201cunited, support[ed] one another, and of course own[ed] the media and the money.\u201d Responding to negative reactions to U.S. embassy social media postings extending Hanukkah wishes to the Jewish community, another commentator wrote, \u201cWhat is this cringe-worthy fear we have toward Jews? \u2026. Is this who we have become in a country whose heritage prides itself on coexistence? What a pity. What a loss for us.\u201d Columnists for the newspaper al-Qabas decried the current state of the Islamic world, one pointing to the influence of extremist clerics who encouraged violence and hatred of the \u201cother,\u201d and another noting the lack of freedom of religion in Islamic states, stating that \u201cMuslim states are all sectarian, racist, and bigoted.\u201d Hotels, stores, and businesses continued to mark non-Islamic holidays, such as Christmas, Easter, and Diwali.

According to Forum 18, an international religious freedom organization, on May 17, the Andijan criminal court sentenced former religious prisoner Oybek Khamidov to five years in prison for sharing a prohibited audio sermon with his wife. Forum 18 reported that on June 23, a Bukhara court sentenced Bobirjon Tukhtamurodov to five years and one month in prison for participating in a group that met to study the banned works of Islamic theologian Said Nursi. During the year, the government registered four religious groups, including three churches and a Baha\u2019i Faith congregation, but it did not register any of the 16 religious organizations that had sought and been denied registration in 2021. A U.S. entity reported that while the religion law \u2013 revised in 2021 \u2013 streamlined the registration process, many aspects of the legislation remained seriously inadequate in comparison to internationally recognized best practices. According to the entity, problematic provisions of the law included continued criminalization of unregistered religious organizations, state control over religious literature, and prohibitions on private teaching of religion. Despite the removal of restrictions on religious attire for those outside government, media outlets continued to report uneven implementation of this aspect of the new law. On May 6, according to media reports, local government officials detained approximately 10 men in Tashkent and forcibly shaved off their beards, threatening them with 15 days\u2019 imprisonment for failure to comply with the \u201clawful demands of a law enforcement officer.\u201d According to government spokespersons, the government continued to strictly control religious education for youth, including by shutting down private religious schools operating without government permission and fining individuals who provided unauthorized religious education. Human rights activists continued to state that President Shavkat Mirziyoyev\u2019s reforms and the law on religion did not resolve the cases of prisoners who remained incarcerated under former President Islam Karimov for their religious practices and beliefs. According to local activists, despite improvements and the release of many religious prisoners since the start of Mirziyoyev\u2019s presidency in 2016, a significant number of prisoners remained in custody for engaging in peaceful religious practices.\n\nMembers of religious minority groups again stated that converts from Islam in their religious communities experienced social pressure from the majority Muslim population. Human rights activists reported an increase in anti-Christian, antisemitic, anti-Western, and misogynist content on social media channels of popular Islamic bloggers such as Abror Muxtor Aliy. In September, authorities dismissed Aliy, who has approximately half a million followers across dozens of channels on several social media outlets, from two government positions in the country\u2019s Islamic academy and muftiate.\n\nIn its public outreach and private meetings, the U.S. embassy drew attention to the continuing inability of religious groups to register as official religious organizations, of groups that proselytize to discuss their beliefs openly, and of parents to educate their children in their faith.

On November 21, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) issued a recommendation that the Seimas reject the 2017 application by Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses for state-recognized religious association status. On December 29, President Gitanas Naus\u0117da signed into law a revision to the 2011 Good Will Compensation law, passed by the Seimas on December 20, that will provide an additional \u20ac37 million ($39.5 million) in compensation for Jewish private and heirless property expropriated by the Nazis and Soviets. The legislation provides symbolic compensation for property that belonged to Lithuanian Jews before or during World War II and was not covered by earlier legislation. Prime Minister Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117, who personally sponsored the bill, stressed the country\u2019s unfulfilled obligation to compensate survivors for remaining Jewish private and heirless property and to recognize the Holocaust past.  On December 22, the President signed a law that creates a process for removing monuments promoting the ideologies of the Soviet and Nazi occupation eras. These include monuments to widely accused Nazi collaborators Juozas Krik\u0161taponis, who is honored by a monument in Ukmerg\u0117 District, and Jonas Noreika, who is recognized with plaques in Vilnius and \u0160iauliai. On January 27, Prime Minister \u0160imonyt\u0117 said the Vilnius Palace of Concerts and Sports could become a museum or memorial dedicated to the history of the country\u2019s Jews.\n\nThere were numerous incidents during the year of Holocaust memorial sites being defaced with the \u201cV\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d symbols of Russia\u2019s military and its invasion of Ukraine. The government denounced and investigated these incidents. Anonymous online commentators continued to express negative views of Muslim migrants. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses representatives said their community members often faced hostility in society and that religiously motivated crimes went unreported due to a lack of faith in law enforcement.\n\nIn December, the U.S. Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues visited the country and met with government officials and conducted several public outreach events to reinforce the importance of religious tolerance, Holocaust education, and compensation for Holocaust-era survivors. The Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officers met regularly with a wide range of government officials to promote religious freedom and discuss related issues, including restitution of private and heirless property for Holocaust victims and their families, and integrating religious minorities, including Muslim migrants, into society. They also discussed these issues with Jewish community leaders. The Ambassador also met with Catholic and Karaite community leaders to discuss issues related to religious freedom. Embassy officers held discussions on religious freedom with Russian Orthodox and Tatar community members. The Ambassador and embassy officers also took part in, and delivered remarks at, multiple events throughout the year commemorating the Holocaust. The embassy used social media to promote respect for human rights, including religious freedom, throughout the year.",

The law prohibits public incitement to hostile acts against religious groups. Antidiscrimination legislation also prohibits discrimination on religious grounds. Citizens have the right to sue the government for constitutional violations of religious freedom.\n\nThe government continued its efforts to address hate crimes, including those motivated by religion, and specifically enhanced its efforts to address antisemitism. As part of its implementation of 38 concrete measures against antisemitism recommended by the 2021 National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism, the government established an executive department in the Federal Chancellery on Austrian Jewish Cultural Heritage and announced the \u201cPrevention of Antisemitism through Education\u201d initiative. During the year, the Federal Chancellery\u2019s Office for Religious Affairs continued to implement stricter annual government monitoring of the finances of mosques and Muslim cultural associations, focusing on financial flows from foreign state institutions.\n\nPhysical violence against individuals or vandalism of property based on religion continued to be rare. Most 301 religiously motivated incidents during the year involved hate speech, insults, and incitement of violence. The Jewish Religious Society (IKG) reported 381 antisemitic incidents in the first half of 2022, down from 562 in the first half of 2021, the year of the largest annual number of cases (965) since documentation began 20 years ago.

According to media reports, in August, Roman Catholic bishops warned that insecurity was leading churches to close and forcing more priests and nuns to flee due to the conflict, which saw major fighting in Afar, Amhara, and Tigray in the north of the country. While urging the parties in the conflict to end the suffering, Cardinal Surafel Berhaneyesus said citizens in many places were still being killed and exiled because of their Tigrayan identity. On November 2, the government and Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) signed a cessation of hostilities agreement (COHA) to end the conflict. In April, members of the Muslim community protested in Addis Ababa during Ramadan after school officials prohibited students from conducting salat prayers (regular daytime prayers) at school. The Addis Ababa Education Bureau resolved the matter by allowing students to conduct prayers during the school day outside of the campus grounds.\n\nIn April, rioters reportedly killed over 20 Muslim individuals during three days of violence in response to the funeral of a Muslim cleric in Gondar. In October, media outlets reported that an armed group killed an EOTC deacon and kidnapped 11 worshippers at Gebre Guracha Town in Oromia Region. In November, the Ethiopia Observer website reported that gunmen killed at least 15 persons and injured others while they gathered for worship at the Muleta Gela Ethiopian Evangelical Mekane Yesus Church (EECMY), an evangelical Protestant church located in Galo Kebele, East Wollega, Oromia Region. In January, evangelical Protestants and the EOTC disagreed over the ownership and usage of Meskel Square in Addis Ababa. In February, the EOTC split into two and a separate faction established the Tigrayan Orthodox Tawehedo Church (TOTC). In July, the Ethiopian Islamic Affairs Supreme Council (EIASC) changed leadership from Sufi Hajji Mufti Omer Idris to Salafist Hajji Ibrahim Tufa.\n\nU.S. government officials met with senior religious leaders to advocate peaceful resolution to conflicts in the north and elsewhere around the country. This included an April 14 meeting with EOTC Patriarch Abune Mathias as well as July meetings in Gondar with local religious leaders and the opening of a Jewish community center in Debre Birhan, where U.S. officials participated in the launch ceremony and engaged with the local community. The Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires hosted an interfaith iftar on April 20 and discussed the unique history of religion in the country.

The Upholding Republican Values law, enacted in 2021, provides authorities with broad powers to monitor and dissolve religious organizations and groups they determine to be promoting ideas contrary to French values. The constitution includes the concept of secularism, and the law prohibits the wearing of conspicuous religious symbols in public spaces such as schools.\n\nIn July, the Constitutional Council ruled that the provision of the Upholding Republican Values law dealing with the obligation of associations to declare their religious affiliation in order to benefit from advantages intended for religious associations was constitutional. While the law does not specifically mention Islam, critics stated the law targeted and stigmatized Muslims and noted that President Emmanuel Macron had initially proposed the law to combat \u201cIslamist separatism.\u201d In a joint statement responding to the court\u2019s decision, the Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox churches said they would remain vigilant regarding the law\u2019s execution. By decree, the government dissolved several Muslim organizations and deported several imams accused of \u201cinciting hatred, violence, and discrimination.\u201d In August, the Ministry of Interior said the government suspected 99 of the 2,623 mosques in the country of being radical and proceeded to close 24 mosques. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses stated that the government published what the church said was \u201cdemonstrably untrue\u201d information about the Witnesses on government websites; the Ministry of Interior later posted a rebuttal statement from the Witnesses on its website. Appeals courts upheld rulings against a local law that would have allowed body-covering burkinis in public pools and in favor of a local bar association rule banning the wearing of religious symbols, including headscarves, by court personnel. The government, however, expressed opposition to a proposed ban on headscarves and religious symbols in sports competitions. A government report decried what it said was a decrease in secularism in public schools, including increased wearing of Islamic attire, which it partially attributed to harmful outside influences, and it reported an increasing number of infringements to secularism legislation. The government also used the Upholding Republican Values law to close certain schools, and under the law, local officials sharply limited homeschooling for religious reasons. President Macron and other government officials continued to condemn antisemitic, anti-Muslim, and anti-Christian acts, take part in public demonstrations of support for religious communities, and deploy security forces to protect religious sites.\n\nThere were instances of religiously motivated crimes and other abuses against Christians, Jews, and Muslims, such as physical assaults, threats, hate speech, discrimination, and vandalism, including a knife attack against a Catholic priest and a nun in the Church of Saint-Pierre-d\u2019Arene in Nice during a Mass. Two high-profile cases involving suspected antisemitic motives attracted national attention, including the death of an observant Jew fleeing from a group of attackers and the killing of an elderly individual. In January, a study on antisemitism commissioned by the American Jewish Committee (AJC)-Paris found that most members of the French Jewish community had been subjected to some form of antisemitic behavior during their lives; the committee\u2019s director said that Jews experienced 40-50 percent of racist acts in the country, although they constituted only 1 percent of the population. There were continued acts of vandalism against churches and mosques, and Minister of Interior G\u00e9rald Darmanin announced a four-million-euro ($4.2 million) budget appropriation to secure places of worship.\n\nOfficials from the U.S. embassy, consulates general, and American Presence Posts (APPs) discussed religious tolerance, antisemitic, and anti-Muslim acts, the role of religious freedom in combating violent extremism, and cooperation on these issues with officials at the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs and the Interministerial Delegation to Fight against Racism, Antisemitism, and Anti-LGBT Hate (DILCRAH). The Ambassador and senior government officials met regularly with religious communities and their leaders throughout the country to discuss religious freedom concerns and encourage interfaith cooperation and tolerance, including engaging Christian, Jewish, and Muslim representatives in Strasbourg, Paris, Marseille, Bordeaux, Lyon, and Toulouse and raising Holocaust awareness in Marseille and Strasbourg. The embassy sponsored events to combat religious discrimination and religiously motivated hate crimes, such as projects bringing together youth of different faiths and a roundtable with religious leaders, and regularly used social media to convey messages highlighting issues pertaining to religious freedom.",

On a different constitutional issue, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office also sought to extend the four-year term of parliament to five, via a separate constitutional amendment, thus postponing the April 2023 elections to 2024, stating that the country could not afford to pay for an election and host the two-week 2023 Pacific Games in the same year. Religious groups opposed this effort to extend elections, stating they feared further civil unrest, following the 2021 riots in the capital. The Prime Minister\u2019s Office responded by publicly reprimanding religious groups for their opposition.\n\nThere were reports of rumors spread by dominant religious groups denigrating the reputation of minority religious groups.\n\nRepresentatives of the U.S. Mission in Solomon Islands discussed religious tolerance and the proposed constitutional amendment to declare Solomon Islands a Christian country with government officials during the year.

The Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs (MEIA) continued to guide and monitor the content of sermons in mosques, Islamic religious education, and the dissemination of Islamic religious material by broadcast media, actions it said were intended to combat violent extremism. The government restricted the distribution of non-Islamic religious materials as well as Islamic materials it deemed inconsistent with the Maliki school of Sunni Islam.\n\nIn August, the Oued-Zem Court of First Instance (trial court) sentenced blogger Fatima Karim to two years in prison and fined her 50,000 dirhams ($4,800) for insulting Islam.

Groups that had closed because they could not meet these requirements often consolidated with other groups so they could have sufficient resources to meet in facilities compliant with the requirements. Religious leaders said they recognized the value in basic infrastructure standards for places of worship but that greater flexibility in applying those standards was merited in different urban and rural contexts. Authorities cited noise pollution ordinances to prohibit several mosques from broadcasting the call to prayer via loudspeaker at the usual volume.

to the country, in 2021 (the most recent year for which data were available), courts adjudicated four cases involving religiously motivated incidents from 2021 and earlier.\u00a0 The OSCE reported 18 incidents targeting Muslims in 2021, 13 targeting Catholics, 15 targeting Orthodox Christians, and three targeting Jews. \u00a0The incidents, all of which were reported to police, included threats against religious believers and officials, disturbances of religious ceremonies, vandalism of religious sites, and desecration of graveyards. \u00a0In March, the Commission for Freedom of Religion of the Islamic Community (Islamic Community Commission) issued its 2021 report on alleged violations of the right to freedom of religion of Muslims in the country, which cited 21 registered cases.\n\nU.S. embassy officials engaged with the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, entity, and municipal authorities as well as religious leaders and communities to promote respect for religious diversity, press for equal treatment for religious minorities, and encourage a greater role for religious communities in fostering reconciliation and mutual understanding.\u00a0 In April and July, the Ambassador met separately with the leaders of the Islamic Community, Catholic Church, Serbian Orthodox Church, and the Jewish Community to discuss interreligious dialogue and reconciliation.\u00a0 In April, the Ambassador led a delegation of international community members to commemorate victims of Donja Gradina, a killing ground of the Jasenovac concentration camp, and emphasized tolerance and the importance of interreligious dialogue at an iftar he hosted. \u00a0In January, a senior embassy official commemorated Holocaust Remembrance by laying flowers at the Jewish cemetery in Sarajevo.\u00a0 In regular meetings with religious groups, embassy officials continued to urge the groups to improve interreligious dialogue to help develop a peaceful and stable society.\u00a0 The

In May, the Legislative Yuan (parliament) passed a law allowing qualified religious groups to change the registration of real estate assets formerly held in the name of individual members.

Officials said the practice of registering temples under individual names had led to conflicts, such as when an owner was ordered to auction off the property or inheritance questions arose.\n\nThe labor standards law continued not to cover domestic service workers and caretakers, who were therefore not legally guaranteed a weekly rest day. Due to this exclusion, many domestic workers continued to be unable to attend religious services. According to the Ministry of Labor (MOL), foreign caregivers and household workers whose employers denied them a weekly rest day to attend religious services could report their cases to the ministry. The MOL continued to coordinate with the Ministry of Health and Welfare to expand subsidized, short-term respite care services for employers, thereby enabling more migrant caregivers to take leave to attend religious services or conduct other activities without risking their employment. Multiple religious groups called on authorities to improve the current long-term care system and raise employer awareness of the significance of finding other assistance to allow migrant caregivers to take a rest day. MOL educated employers via traditional and new media during the year on the importance migrant employees place on attending religious services. Tibetan Buddhist monks again reported they continued to be unable to obtain resident visas for religious work, which authorities said was due to general rules governing foreigners who use travel permits instead of passports, rather than for religious reasons. In July, Pusin Tali, Taiwan\u2019s Ambassador at Large for Religious Freedom, stated at the International Ministerial Conference on Freedom of Religion or Belief in the United Kingdom that diverse religious beliefs could coexist peacefully in Taiwan as long as they did not endanger Taiwan\u2019s security. The ambassador subsequently said that if, however, a religious belief had a \u201cpolitical purpose\u201d and advocated for the unification of Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China, that belief would pose a threat to Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty and security.\n\nThere were no reports during the year of significant societal actions affecting religious freedom.\n\nThroughout the year, American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) representatives engaged with legislators and ministries, as well as with Ambassador Pusin.

Congregations are not required to register by law, although registration is required to receive tax benefits. Religious communities must comply with annual reporting requirements to maintain government recognition.\n\nIn January, the government introduced the country\u2019s first action plan to combat antisemitism as part of the budget agreement for a broad national action plan against racism. In August, the newly created Commission for the Forgotten Women\u2019s Struggle recommended that the government ban hijabs for students in elementary schools. The commission\u2019s recommendation subsequently saw a large public protest in Copenhagen on August 26. Jewish and Muslim communities and the national teachers\u2019 association opposed the proposal. The government did not act on the proposal by year\u2019s end. In April, a provision of earlier legislation that criminalized clerics if they condoned certain actions as part of religious education, including supporting violence in sermons, became permanent. The Danish Institute of Human Rights (DIHR) and major church organizations said the provision restricted freedom of expression and subjected religious leaders to a wider interpretation of criminal behavior than other citizens. In February, the Supreme Court ruled it was legal to give an unconscious patient who was a member of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses a blood transfusion in a situation where the patient\u2019s life was in danger. A spokesman for Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses stated the organization considered the decision to be a \u201cclear violation of the fundamental rights\u201d guaranteed in the European Convention on Human Rights. Speaking to a conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in September, a Muslim rights activist said the government\u2019s stated policy of better integrating ethnic and religious minority communities discriminated against Muslims. The European Islamophobia Report released in November stated concerns about \u201cstructural barriers for Muslims,\u201d including the use of a government statistical category which could be used to discriminate against Muslims in housing and other social benefits. The Finance Act of 2022, which became law in December 2021, included a four-year grant to strengthen governmental efforts to combat hate crimes, including by creating an action plan against racism that would also address religiously motivated hate crimes. The Ministry of the Interior and Housing continued to implement the government\u2019s action plan, under the General Housing Act, to eliminate what it termed \u201cparallel societies\u201d by 2030 to better integrate citizens and residents. In a report published in April, the ministry stated that from when the law went into force to the end of 2021, the government had converted 1,143 public housing buildings to private housing, sold 648 public housing buildings and demolished 4,037 public housing units.\n\nSome representatives from the Muslim community said there was an increase in religiously motivated crimes across the country but said these were not always reported due to a distrust of law enforcement and in some cases linguistic challenges faced by imams. On May 31, international media and a nongovernmental organization (NGO) reported that vandals damaged or knocked down approximately 30 tombstones, including 14 Jewish ones, in a cemetery in the north of the country.

Some Muslim community leaders and NGOs said the government continued to influence and favor the state-funded religious group All Muslims of All Georgia (AMAG).

The GOC and Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) recognized Orthodox churches in both regions as belonging to the GOC, but GOC officials stated de facto authorities in South Ossetia pressured Orthodox churches to merge with the ROC, while some religious figures in Abkhazia continued to support turning the region\u2019s Orthodox churches into an autocephalous Abkhaz Orthodox Church. Sources said the ROC tacitly supported the autocephalic ambitions of breakaway churches without seeking formal recognition of their autocephaly from the GOC. De facto authorities in South Ossetia declared GOC religious services illegal but permitted them in practice. In Abkhazia, de facto authorities prohibited GOC clergy from entering the region. Most GOC worshippers in Abkhazia were unable to travel to Tbilisi-administered territory to celebrate Orthodox Christmas or Orthodox Easter due to lacking Abkhazia \u201cpassports.\u201d\n\nDuring the year, the Human Rights Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MOIA) investigated eight cases involving crimes reported as religiously motivated, compared with 13 cases in 2021. By year\u2019s end, the Public Defender\u2019s Office reported it had received four complaints of discrimination or hate crimes based on religion during the year, compared with five in 2021. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses reported nine incidents against the group during the year, including cases involving violence, vandalism, and theft from a kingdom hall, compared with six in 2021. The NGO Media Development Foundation documented 98 instances of religiously intolerant statements on television, online, and in print by media representatives, political parties, clergy, public organizations, and others during the year, the majority of them expressing anti-Muslim sentiment, compared with 117 such incidents in 2021.\n\nAccording to the TDI, there were documented instances of antisemitic statements being shared on social media, including two statements of others that GOC clergy reposted.

Security forces disrupted religious services while pursuing armed separatists, detained religious leaders suspected of aiding separatists, detained a pastor accused of defaming Islam, and instructed the pastor of an evangelical Christian church to avoid raising sociopolitical issues during his sermons. Religious leaders expressed frustration with the government\u2019s long-running failure to register new religious groups and said many requests were pending, some for a decade or longer.\n\nThe U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa (ISIS-WA) launched violent attacks against local communities, disrupted church activities, and caused Christians to live in fear in the Far North Region. The overall number of terrorist incidents, however, significantly decreased compared to preceding years, according to the newspaper L\u2019Oeil du Sahel. Media outlets reported that between January and June, recurrent attacks by Boko Haram and ISIS-WA resulted in the pillaging of churches, arson, and deaths.\n\nArmed separatist groups in the Northwest and Southwest regions set fire to churches and kidnapped numerous religious leaders and dozens of seminary students. Throughout the year, Muslim and Christian leaders initiated interfaith activities aimed at facilitating interreligious dialogue, promoting peaceful coexistence of different religious groups, combating hate speech, and seeking a peaceful resolution to the country\u2019s multiple crises. In January, during a worship service at Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral in Bonadibong, Douala, a Pentecostal Christian smashed multiple statues that he described as a form of idolatry. In March, members of the mostly Christian population in Esu, Northwest Region, burned down the local mosque following the killing of their traditional leader by suspected Muslim Mbororo herders. In July, suspected separatists kidnapped and killed four Muslim Mbororo herders in Wum, Northwest Region.

In June, a Rio de Janeiro court sentenced a Pentecostal pastor to 18 years and six months in prison for racism, incitement, and other crimes for producing and publishing videos attacking Jews and members of other religious groups. Media outlets reported on the prominent role of religion in the country\u2019s presidential election, where incumbent Jair Bolsonaro and candidate Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (commonly known as Lula) sought support from evangelical Christians and Roman Catholics.\n\nMedia outlets reported cases of religious intolerance in different parts of the country. Acts of religious intolerance ranged from derogatory name calling of an Afro-Brazilian religious ritual to destroying places of worship. Although only approximately 2 percent of the population are followers of Afro-Brazilian religions, including Candombl\u00e9 and Umbanda, a disproportionate number of cases registered by the human rights hotline continued to involve practitioners of Afro-Brazilian religions. Media and other sources reported instances of religious intolerance and discrimination against individuals and communities, especially intolerance and discrimination impacting Afro-Brazilians, and an increase in antisemitism and the presence of neo-Nazi groups. In November, media outlets reported that a 16-year-old wearing military-style clothing and a swastika killed four persons and wounded 12 at two schools in the town of Aracruz in Esp\u00edrito Santo State and that his motives for the killings were unclear. In October, representatives of Indigenous communities denounced before the UN Human Rights Council the increase in systematic violence motivated by religious intolerance, including the burning of Indigenous places of worship by members of some evangelical Christian groups.\n\nDuring the year, U.S. embassy officials engaged with government counterparts to emphasize the importance of religious freedom, including for minority religious groups. Embassy and Washington officials discussed the promotion of religious freedom with their counterparts during the virtual U.S.-Brazil Human Rights Dialogue in February. Embassy officials raised concerns with the government about reports of widespread intolerance of Afro-Brazilian religions and the rise in antisemitism. Embassy officials also discussed the importance of interfaith dialogue, peace, and religious tolerance with these government officials. Embassy and consulate officials engaged in activities that promoted religious freedom, including attending Candombl\u00e9 and Umbanda ceremonies, visiting a synagogue, and meeting with religious leaders representing Jewish and Afro-Brazilian faiths.",

As part of the government\u2019s campaign against groups pursuing violent opposition to the state, particularly the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People\u2019s Army (CPP-NPA), some religious workers who were identified by the government as communist members or sympathizers were threatened and harassed, while some were indicted on charges of providing funds to the CPP-NPA. In July, religious leaders representing Catholic religious orders issued a statement saying that the practice of public labeling of individuals as being affiliated with insurgent, terrorist, or separatist groups \u2013 also known as \u201cred-tagging\u201d \u2013 would not deter them from criticizing the new government on moral and ethical issues, should they arise. Also in July, a spokesperson for the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) expressed opposition to proposed legislation that would legalize divorce. The Commission on Human Rights expressed concern with a local ordinance that fined unvaccinated worshipers attending religious services. In December, the House of Representatives Committee on Human Rights passed the Magna Carta of Religious Freedom Act which lawmakers say aims to protect every citizen\u2019s right to religious freedom. Humanists, atheists, Muslims, and other religious minorities expressed concern that the bill favored Christians and did not offer equal protections on the right to not believe in any form of religion. The legislation remained pending at year\u2019s end.\n\nMuslim public figures, such as Senator Robin Padilla, the only Muslim senator, stated that Muslims continued to face discrimination and human rights abuses in the country.\n\nThe U.S. embassy conducted a broad range of engagement throughout the year with the government to highlight the importance of international religious freedom.

Of the eight functioning mosques, seven were available for all five daily prayers and seven had the necessary bathroom and ablution facilities. The Department of Antiquities continued to limit regular access to the Hala Sultan Tekke Mosque to only two of the five daily prayers, although it routinely granted expanded access during Ramadan and at the request of the imam. On May 13, the government lifted restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 on the number of persons allowed to attend religious services. Representatives of the Jewish community continued to report authorities performed autopsies on deceased members of the community for deaths that were not suspicious, a practice they said violated Jewish religious beliefs and practice. They stated that despite their continuing efforts to raise the issue with government authorities during the year, it remained unresolved at year\u2019s end. Authorities continued to deny permission to perform animal slaughter for food production according to Jewish law.

In August, the TCCH completed the restoration of Orounda Mosque in Nicosia District. In September, the Department of Antiquities began the long-awaited restoration of the Limassol Grand Mosque after the government unexpectedly closed the mosque in 2019. According to media reports, the Government of Qatar donated \u20ac1.2 million ($1.28 million) for the restoration of Limassol Grand Mosque.\n\nSome religious minority groups continued to report societal pressure to engage in public Greek Orthodox religious ceremonies, such as weddings and christenings. Greek Orthodox Christians reported they sometimes faced ostracism from their community if they converted to another religion. Leaders of the main religious groups continued to meet under the framework of the Religious Track of the Cyprus Peace Process (RTCYPP) and advocated greater religious freedom for faith communities across the island.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern that some of the trials did not meet fair trial and due process guarantees, and that the crimes of which the men were convicted did not meet the \u201cmost serious crimes\u201d threshold for capital punishment in international law.  NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW) said its analysis of the court rulings in the cases of 5 of the Shia defendants also noted due process deficiencies, including allegations of torture and forced confessions.  On March 14, Shia news website Shia Waves said the government refused to hand over the bodies of the 41 men to their families and banned their funerals.  The government also sought the death penalty against other Shia defendants whose trials, on charges ranging from terrorism to participating in demonstrations, had not started or which were ongoing.  The government continued to imprison or detain Shia clerics, other Shia, and Sunni clerics on a variety of charges.  The government continued to prohibit the public practice of any non-Islamic religion.  In practice, there was increased but still limited tolerance of private, non-Islamic religious gatherings and public displays of non-Islamic religious symbols, and religious practitioners at variance with the government-promoted form of Sunni Islam remained vulnerable to detention, harassment, and, for noncitizens, deportation.  Authorities continued to permit public commemorations of Ashura and other Shia holidays in Qatif, home to the country\u2019s largest Shia population.  According to Shia community members, the government allowed processions and gatherings to continue with greater coordination between the Shia community and authorities, and Ashura commemorations were marked by improved relations between the Shia and other communities and public calls for mutual tolerance.  Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPC) agents spent much of their time developing Islamic awareness campaigns, rather than their historic role of patrolling the streets and enforcing compliance with strict Islamic observance.  Former CPVPV officers said that the committee, effectively, \u201cno longer exists\u201d and that it had been \u201cdeprived of all its prerogatives\u201d and \u201cno longer has a clear role.\u201d  In its annual review of content in Saudi textbooks in June, the NGO Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-se) stated that antisemitic content was largely eliminated, and the government had \u201ccontinue[d] to remove extremist content and proceed in a positive direction.\u201d\n\nUsers on some social media platforms posted disparaging remarks about members of various religious groups or \u201csects.\u201d  Terms such as \u201crejectionists,\u201d which Shia considered insulting, were found in some social media discourse.

The U.S. Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom visited the country in May and participated in the Forum on Promoting Common Values among the Followers of Religion, organized by the Saudi-sponsored Muslim World League, where he spoke about the urgent need to protect religious freedom worldwide and urged countries to repeal and cease enforcement of blasphemy and apostasy laws.  In June, the U.S. State Department\u2019s Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism visited Saudi Arabia and met with officials, including the Minister of Islamic Affairs, the HRC president, the deputy foreign minister, deputy education minister, King Abdulaziz Center for National Dialogue and the MWL.

In February, an Athens court sentenced two human rights activists to a 12-months suspended prison sentence for having falsely accused a Greek Orthodox Metropolitan of racist and antisemitic hate speech. In August, parliament amended the process under which the government appoints muftis in Thrace. Turkish-speaking members of the Muslim Minority of Thrace said members of the faith should elect their own leaders without government interference. The government granted permits for the establishment of six new houses of prayer operated by a group of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, an Old Calendarist group, and four Pentecostal groups. The government revoked the permits of five houses of prayer, four administered by Pentecostals and one run by a Muslim group.

In February, Minister of Health Thanos Plevris apologized to the Jewish community for \u201coffensive views\u201d he had expressed while a member of the Popular Orthodox Rally Party (LAOS). In March, President Katerina Sakellaropoulou and local officials participated in a march in Thessaloniki to commemorate Holocaust victims.

At year\u2019s end, more than half of the country\u2019s prewar population remained displaced, including 6.9 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 6.7 million refugees.

The regime continued to use a law that allows for the creation of redevelopment zones designated for reconstruction, as well as property confiscations, to reward those loyal to the regime and to create obstacles for refugees and IDPs who wished to reclaim their property or return to their homes; in line with the demographics of the country, this move affected the majority Sunni population more frequently than other groups.  The Alawite minority continued to hold an elevated political status disproportionate to its numbers, particularly in leadership positions in the military, security, and intelligence services.  Sources stated that the regime attempted to project an image as a secular protector of Christians, but human rights organizations reported the regime intentionally destroyed churches and detained numerous Christian citizens.

A press report stated that TSOs had wholly or partially desecrated or destroyed 18 of the 19 Yezidi shrines and sanctuaries in northern Syria and had imposed Islam on Yezidi children.  Human rights organizations and documentation-gathering groups reported that Yezidis and other residents, particularly in Kurdish areas, were often victims of TSO abuses.  Reports also indicated that the small number of Christians remaining in Aleppo were very concerned about possible attacks by TSOs.  Human rights organizations stated that ISIS often targeted civilians, persons suspected of collaborating with security forces, and groups ISIS deemed to be apostates.

In September, the government announced the second of two grants to the VCC of 25 million vatu ($209,000), with half disbursed during the year in furtherance of the \u201cGovernment Church Partnership Program\u201d initiated in prior years. Religious minorities continued to criticize the government for not including non-Christian faith groups in celebrations of national events.\n\nAccording to the VCC, religious minorities were respected within society, and any tension between groups was mostly due to tribal and ethnic issues. Some members of minority faith groups, however, stated members of dominant religious denominations ridiculed their beliefs. In most rural areas, in accordance with traditional customs, the establishment of a new religious group generally required agreement by the chief along with community consensus. In June, the Ecclesiastical District of Australia East opened three new local worship spaces in the country to cater to the growing number of Church of Christ members. In December, the Presbyterian Church of Vanuatu held a worship service dedicated to a VCC-led campaign against gender-based violence.\n\nThere is no permanent U.S. diplomatic presence in the country, but officials from the U.S. embassy in Papua, New Guinea, were dual-accredited to Vanuatu. Representatives from the embassy discussed with government officials the importance of interfaith dialogue and the inclusion of religious minorities in national events and programs. Embassy representatives discussed religious freedom issues with leaders of the VCC, religious minority groups, and civil society organizations.",

Religious freedom activists again said local authorities approved registration applications based more on religious groups\u2019 perspective on politics than on religious doctrine.\n\nFor the fourth year in a row, authorities did not recognize any new religious organizations, including chapters of larger, previously approved groups. During the year, the Vietnam Baptist Convention (VBC) filed approximately 40 registration requests for collective religious practice in northern mountain provinces, but few were successful. One pastor reported that when he tried to register a new meeting point for his congregation, local authorities requested a list of his church\u2019s members. The pastor later learned that subsequent visits by police to his church\u2019s members discouraged others from joining his congregation. Many religious leaders across the country continued to report improving conditions compared with prior years, such as better relations between unregistered religious groups and local authorities, quicker approval of permits for religious events, and a reduction in aggressive forms of harassment, such as regular questioning and threats. Members of recognized groups or those with certificates of registration said they were generally able to practice their beliefs with less government interference than unregistered groups. Members of some religious groups continued to report that certain local and provincial authorities used noncompliance with the required registration procedures to slow, delegitimize, and suppress religious activities of groups that resisted close government management of their leadership, training programs, assemblies, and other activities. The government again did not hold any government official accountable for failure to follow legal deadlines and written registration notification requirements contained in the LBR.\n\nThere were reports of conflicts, at times violent, between members of unregistered and registered or recognized religious groups or between believers and nonbelievers. Independent Cao Dai adherents in the Southwest region reportedly faced harassment from registered state-sanctioned Cao Dai adherents. Independent Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) monks in Cu Chi District of Ho Chi Minh City also reported harassment from the local community. In both cases, police officers reportedly neither intervened nor held those responsible for the harassment accountable. Religious activists blamed authorities for \u201cmanipulating\u201d recognized religious groups by interfering in their elections and appointments of their leadership and accused their agents or proxies of causing conflicts in order to suppress the activities of unregistered groups.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador, the Consul General in Ho Chi Minh City, other senior U.S. embassy and consulate general officials, and the U.S. Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom regularly urged authorities to allow all religious groups to operate freely. They sought reduced levels of government intervention in the affairs of recognized and registered religious groups and urged an end to restrictions on, and harassment of, groups lacking recognition or registration. They stressed to government officials that progress on religious freedom and human rights was critical to an improved bilateral relationship. They advocated religious freedom in visits across the country, including to the Northwest Highlands, Mekong River Delta, and Central Vietnam. With the Government Committee on Religious Affairs (GCRA), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security, and provincial and local authorities, U.S. government officials raised specific cases of abuses, as well as of government harassment, against Catholics, Protestant groups including independent Pentecostal groups, the UBCV, independent Hoa Hao groups, independent Cao Dai groups, and ethnic minority house churches such as the Duong Van Minh group. U.S. government officials called for the increased registration of church congregations around the country and for improvement in registration policies by making them more uniform and transparent. They urged the government to resolve outstanding land rights disputes fairly and peacefully with religious groups. U.S. government officials also called for unfettered access to religious materials by prisoners. The Ambassador and other embassy and consulate general officials met with the leadership of both registered and unregistered religious groups and attended religious ceremonies to demonstrate support for religious freedom.\n\nOn November 30, 2022, in accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as amended, the Secretary of State placed Vietnam on the Special Watch List for having engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom. In December, the Ambassador informed the government of its inclusion on the Special Watch List and urged it to improve efforts to protect religious freedom.",

After registration, the organizations must comply with applicable regulations imposed on all registered organizations or be subject to a fine.\n\nIn the face of a worsening security situation, military officers led by Lt. Col. Paul-Henri Sandago Damiba deposed elected President Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9 in a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat on January 24 and became president of a transition government. In a second military uprising on September 30, Damiba was ousted by Captain Ibrahim Traor\u00e9. During both the January coup and the September military takeover, religious leaders served as mediators to try to prevent bloodshed. On February 25, then Transition President Damiba met with religious and customary leaders and stated terrorism in the country was mainly internally driven because it was Burkinabe citizens who had taken up arms against their country. In March, a new government was formed and included for the first time a Ministry for Religious and Customary Affairs. On July 12, Transition Prime Minister Albert Ou\u00e9draogo led a delegation to attend the installation ceremony of the new president of the Federation of Islamic Associations of Burkina (FAIB). Then Transition Minister for Religious and Customary Affairs Issaka Sourwema, who was part of the delegation, praised the contributions of the Muslim community for their efforts to promote peace and social cohesion in the country. Throughout their time in office, President Damiba and other transition government officials condemned the stigmatization of vulnerable communities and warned against extremist sermons. The authorities which took power following the September 30 military takeover disbanded the Ministry of Religious and Customary Affairs and distributed its functions to other ministries. Despite these changes, transition authorities maintained policies permitting the free practice of religion in areas they controlled.\n\nInternational and local media outlets reported that terrorist groups, armed insurgents, and jihadists expanded their control, continued their campaign of violence, and sometimes targeted places of worship or religious leaders. Domestic and transnational terrorist groups conducted more attacks and inflicted more violence against civilians than in 2021, including numerous targeted killings based on religious identity, according to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Deaths attributed to terrorism rose to 1,135 in 2022 from 759 in 2021, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace Global Terrorism Index. Terrorists killed or kidnapped imams, other clergy, and worshippers, while attacking and destroying mosques, churches, and animists\u2019 places of worship. Although the identity of those responsible for many attacks was unknown, observers attributed most attacks to Ansaroul Islam, Islamic State in Greater Sahara (ISIS-GS), and Jamaat Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), all designated by the U.S. government as terrorist organizations. Media reported numerous incidents of terrorist violence. Media and international NGOs reported that violent extremist organizations enforced their ideology and interpretation of Islamic law in the region with the threat of violence for noncompliance. For example, attackers forced members of communities in the northern part of the country to dress in specific \u201cIslamic\u201d garb, although observers noted this was also occurring across other areas of the country. Terrorists closed and burned schools and killed teachers for using a secular curriculum and for teaching in French rather than Arabic, according to media reports. As of December, 6,253 schools had been closed, depriving nearly 700,000 students of access to education. More than 76 municipalities were declared to be completely outside the education system. On October 28, Education Minister Joseph Andr\u00e9 Ou\u00e9draogo characterized the impact of insecurity on education as \u201cextremely serious.\u201d\n\nHuman rights organizations and religious groups continued to express concern that religiously targeted violence had harmed the traditional peaceful coexistence of religious groups in the country. Academic and other observers stated there was stigmatization of the mostly Muslim ethnic Fulani community because of the community\u2019s perceived sympathy for Islamists, which further aggravated existing societal tensions. Members of the Burkinabe Muslim Community Organization, the Catholic Archdiocese of Ouagadougou, and the Federation of Evangelical Churches continued to state that despite an increase in religiously motivated attacks, religious tolerance remained a common value, citing numerous examples of families of mixed faiths and religious leaders attending each other\u2019s holidays and celebrations. Members of the largest religious communities promoted interfaith dialogue and tolerance through public institutions such as the FAIB, which conducted campaigns promoting interfaith dialogue throughout the country. During the September military takeover, religious leaders worked to avoid bloodshed between the warring factions.\n\nU.S. embassy officials conducted discussions with a wide range of transition government agencies and officials, including in the Office of the President, on the continued increase in religiously motivated attacks, particularly in the Sahel and Est Regions. On May 23 and September 16, the Ambassador met with the then Minister of Religious and Customary Affairs to discuss his priorities and ways to protect religious freedom. During the September meeting, the Ambassador expressed concern over increasing extremist sermons and preaching in some religious denominations.\n\nThroughout the year, the Ambassador met with imams and other Muslim leaders, as well as Catholic and Protestant leaders, to reinforce U.S. support for religious freedom and tolerance and to hear their concerns. The Ambassador also conveyed appreciation for religious leaders who acted as mediators to prevent violence. In addition, embassy officers met with religious leaders to encourage and promote values of religious freedom, interfaith tolerance, and active civil dialogue on these subjects. During the year, the embassy conducted regular outreach with religious figures and religiously oriented civil society organization leaders to better understand threats to religious freedom and tolerance in the country as a result of the unprecedented level of violence against both Christians and Muslims.",

Christian nongovernmental organization (NGO) Release International reported the arrest of 17 women and 12 men after police raided a prayer meeting in Asmara on March 29. According to this NGO, the government continued to imprison more than 300 Christians, as of November 17. Other NGOs estimated authorities continued to detain from 130 to more than 1,000 persons due to their faith, including 20 Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses for refusing to participate in military service or renounce their faith. In October, according to Catholic and other media sources, government security forces arrested an Eritrean Orthodox bishop, an Eritrean Orthodox priest, and a Franciscan priest, reportedly for highlighting government human rights violations in their homilies. They were released on December 29, according to international media. On February 9, former Eritrean Orthodox Church Patriarch Abune Antonios, confined to house arrest since 2006, died while still in detention. On May 20, officials from several NGOs and from the Eritrean Orthodox Church in the United Kingdom wrote to the Eritrean ambassador to the United Kingdom and Ireland to express concern about the government\u2019s continuing \u201cunjust, arbitrary, and indefinite detention\u201d of many citizens, including Christians imprisoned \u201csolely on account of their faith.\u201d Unregistered religious groups lack the privileges of registered groups and their members risked arrest, mistreatment, and renunciation of their faith as a condition of their release. The government allowed some unregistered groups to operate and tolerated their worship activities. International NGOs and international media continued to report that members of all religious groups were, to varying degrees, subjected to government abuses and restrictions. The government continued to deny citizenship to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses after stripping them of citizenship in 1994 for refusing to participate in the referendum that created the independent state of Eritrea. In September, the beginning of the 2022 school year, the last two remaining Catholic schools were closed or converted to public schools.\n\nThe government\u2019s lack of transparency and intimidation of civil society and religious communities continued to create difficulties for individuals who wanted to obtain information on the status of societal respect for religious freedom. International observers, however, continued to state that religious tolerance appeared to be widespread between different groups within society. Churches and mosques are in close proximity to each other, and most citizens congratulated members of other religious groups on the occasions of religious holidays and other events. There were no reports of sectarian violence, and most towns and ethnic groups included members from all the major religious groups.\n\nU.S. officials in Asmara and Washington raised religious freedom concerns with government officials throughout the year, including the imprisonment of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, lack of alternative service for conscientious objectors, and the death of Patriarch Antonios while in detention. U.S. embassy officials further discussed religious freedom on a regular basis with a wide range of individuals, including members of the diplomatic corps based in Asmara and UN officials. Embassy officials used social media and outreach programs to engage the public, highlight the commitment of the United States to religious freedom, and rebut the government\u2019s argument that it does not persecute people based on their religious beliefs.\n\nSince 2004, Eritrea has been designated a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom. On November 30, 2022, the Secretary of State redesignated Eritrea as a CPC and identified the following sanction that accompanied the designation: the ongoing denial of licenses or other approvals for exports or imports of defense articles and services as referenced in 22 CFR 126.1(n) pursuant to section 402(c)(5) of the act.",

Parliament accepted the amendment in a first reading in December 2021, but the government took no further action on it during 2022. On January 27, Minister of Infrastructure and Justice Graziella Marok-Wachter held a hybrid event to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day; her remarks focused on how to confront contemporary antisemitism. The government did not make progress on the \u201cEquality for Muslims\u201d petition filed in 2021 by the Islamic Community of the Principality of Liechtenstein (IGFL), one of the country\u2019s three Islamic associations, which called for the establishment of an Islamic cemetery and an additional Muslim prayer room in the country. According to the Liechtenstein Human Rights Association (LHRA), reluctance from potential landlords, the limited availability of suitable properties, and unaffordable rent costs prevented the IGFL from establishing a cemetery and another prayer room in the country during the year. As a result, the IGFL continued to meet in Sevelen, a Swiss town close to Liechtenstein\u2019s capital, Vaduz.\n\nAccording to the Liechtenstein Institute, a scientific research center and academic institution, Muslims continued to face discrimination in society, particularly Muslim women who wore a headscarf when applying for jobs or housing. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), some religious groups in every municipality continued to open their facilities to other denominations and faiths upon request.\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Bern, Switzerland, which is responsible for diplomatic relations with the country, continued to encourage the promotion of religious freedom in discussions with the government, the LHRA, and NGOs.

According to local media, the president of the NCFF said authorities were \u201cjust looking for reasons to incriminate and close down churches.\u201d The NCFF petitioned the government about the church closures, stating that authorities were wrongly imposing an antiwitchcraft law from 1933 to limit religious rights and eliminate smaller independent religious groups in the country.

It stipulates there shall be no discrimination based on religion. It does not address the right to convert to another faith, nor are there penalties under civil law for doing so. According to the constitution, matters concerning the personal and family status of Muslims come under the jurisdiction of sharia courts. Under sharia, converts from Islam are still considered Muslims and are subject to sharia but are regarded as apostates.\n\nConverts to Islam from Christianity and to Christianity from Islam continued to report security officials questioning them regarding their religious beliefs and practices as well as some instances of surveillance. Converts to Christianity from Islam reported that security officials continued to question them to determine their \u201ctrue\u201d religious beliefs and practices. The Ministry of Awqaf [religious endowments], Islamic Affairs, and Holy Places (MOA) continued to monitor sermons at mosques and required that preachers refrain from political commentary not approved by the government. The government continued to deny official recognition to some religious groups, including Baha\u2019is and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Members of some unregistered religious groups continued to face problems registering their marriages and the religious affiliation of their children and in renewing their residency permits. Some religious minorities, including Christians and Druze, continued to serve in parliament and as cabinet ministers. Throughout the year, King Abdullah publicly met with leaders from various Christian denominations, including those from Protestant denominations not granted official recognition.\n\nSome converts to Christianity from Islam continued to report ostracism as well as physical and verbal abuse from their families and communities, and many worshipped in secret due to the social stigma they faced. Some converts reported persistent threats of violence from family members concerned with protecting traditional honor. Atheists and some converts from Islam expressed interest in resettlement abroad due to discrimination and threats of violence. Converts from Christianity to Islam also reported social stigma from their families and Christian society. Christian women married to Muslim men were more often stigmatized. Nonbelievers reported societal intolerance and discrimination. Religious leaders reported continued online hate speech directed towards religious minorities and moderates, frequently through social media. Some social media users defended interfaith tolerance, with posts condemning content that criticized Christianity or tried to discourage interfaith dialogue. Observers continued to report friction between Christian denominations that were recognized by the government and those that were not. Several Jewish travelers reported antisemitic practices, such as confiscation of religious items by border authorities at ports of entry. The state-affiliated al-Rai news outlet published several articles containing antisemitic content or denials of the Holocaust. In October, the Catholic Center for Studies and Media and the American University in Madaba hosted dozens of students from various universities in the country for a workshop on using social media to promote interfaith harmony.\n\nThe Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officers continued to engage with government officials at all levels, including with the MOA, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, and Royal Hashemite Court, to raise the issues relating to the rights of religious minorities, the protection of cultural resources, and interfaith tolerance. Embassy officers also engaged with Muslim scholars, Christian community leaders and members, and representatives of unrecognized religious groups to promote interfaith tolerance and dialogue. The embassy supported programs promoting religious tolerance, as well as civil society programs seeking to preserve the cultural heritage of religious minorities.",

The constitution delegates regulation of the relationship between the government and religious groups to the 26 cantons. The constitution bans full facial coverings, including the burqa and niqab, in public spaces and imposes fines of up to 1,000 Swiss francs ($1,100) as a penalty, but provides some exceptions, including for religious institutions.\n\nIn July, the Canton of Geneva prohibited public baptisms by free churches, and an appeal was pending at year\u2019s end. On July 29, in the first case concerning the 2020 amendments to the antidiscrimination law, a district court convicted and fined a man on charges of discrimination and inciting hatred as well as obstruction of an official act when he fled from police. The charges stemmed from an anti-LGBTQI+ speech he delivered in June outside the Zurich train station, which primarily consisted of him quoting Biblical text.\n\nA report by the Swiss Federation of Jewish Communities (SIG) and the Foundation against Racism and Antisemitism (GRE) cited 1,024 antisemitic incidents in the country in 2021, compared with 679 in 2020. Most incidents involved postings online but also included public insults, neo-Nazi graffiti, and property damage. A report by the nongovernmental organization (NGO) European Network against Racism, in collaboration with the Federal Commission against Racism, cited 53 incidents against Muslims in 2021. Anti-Muslim incidents were the third most prevalent form of hate crime, following xenophobia and racism, according to the report. The NGO Observatory on Intolerance and Discrimination against Christians in Europe cited several cases of churches being vandalized and damaged, some of which reportedly was attributable to anti-Christian sentiment. Many of the participants in the annual antiabortion \u201cmarch for life\u201d in Oerlikon in September represented religious groups. A large police presence deterred violence against participants by counterdemonstrators, as occurred in previous years.\n\nU.S. embassy officials met with government officials and discussed projects, such as training events and workshops, aimed at promoting religious freedom and tolerance. During the year, embassy staff met with the leadership of various religious groups, including the Federation of Islamic Organizations of Switzerland (FIDS), the Free Churches Association, the Protestant Alliance Association, and the Jewish Community of Bern. In each meeting, embassy staff discussed financial and social discrimination, government support for the country\u2019s religiously affiliated organizations, and other issues pertaining to religious freedom. In January, at a Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony, the Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires underscored the moral importance of remembering the Holocaust, as Jewish communities remain the target of continued attacks.",

        "summary": "The constitution bars the federal and state governments from adopting a state religion, prohibits religious discrimination, and provides for individuals\u2019 freedom to choose, practice, propagate, or change their religion. The constitution provides for states to establish courts based on sharia or customary (traditional) law in addition to common law civil courts, although civil courts have preeminence over all other courts. Sentences may be appealed from sharia and customary courts to civil courts. In addition to civil courts, sharia courts function in 12 northern states and the Federal Capital Territory, and customary courts in most of the 36 states.\n\nCivil society organizations and media stated that general insecurity was prevalent throughout the country, particularly in the North West region. There continued to be frequent violent incidents, particularly in the northern part of the country, affecting both Muslims and Christians, resulting in numerous deaths. Kidnappings and armed robbery by criminal gangs increased in the South as well as the North West, the South South, and the South East. The international Christian organization Open Doors stated that terrorist groups, militant herdsmen, and criminal gangs were responsible for large numbers of fatalities, and Christians were particularly vulnerable. Senior Christian and Muslim religious leaders made statements criticizing what they said was the government\u2019s inaction in the face of continued widespread violence. Following a violent incident in March, the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference in a statement asked the federal government to arrest and prosecute those responsible and said that Nigerians are \u201csick of flimsy excuses and bogus promises to deal with terrorists in the country.\u201d Sultan of Sokoto Mohammed Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, the senior Muslim cleric in the country, said after the same incident that any government that \u201ccannot provide security for its citizens had no moral justification to exist.\u201d The government continued security operations that authorities stated were meant to stem the insecurity and violence throughout the country. In March, governors of all 36 states resolved to establish peacebuilding agencies and adopt a multilevel policing framework to respond to the high level of insecurity in the country. On August 8, according to the outlawed Shia organization Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), characterized by the government as a violent extremist Shia group and whose announced aim is for an Islamic state, security forces fired on a Muharram procession in Zaria, Kaduna State, killing six Shia Muslims. Throughout the year, officials in northern states continued to enforce laws criminalizing blasphemy, a term inclusive of laws prohibiting intentional insult to religion, which are treated separately as they form part of state penal codes, sentencing individuals to maximum penalties. In December, Kano State authorities convicted Muslim cleric Sheikh Abduljabbar Nasiru-Kabara on four counts of capital blasphemy and sentenced him to death for comments he made during a television debate in 2021, which were interpreted as disparaging the Prophet Muhammad. In August, the Federal Court of Appeal in Kano State rejected the appeal of Yahaya Sharif-Aminu and ordered that his case be retried in Kano Sharia Court. Sharif-Aminu, a Tijani Sufi lyricist, was convicted of capital blasphemy and sentenced to death in 2020 based on the words of one of his songs. In November, Sharif-Aminu filed an appeal of the retrial at the Supreme Court of Nigeria. In July in Bauchi State, a sharia court sentenced three men to death by stoning for homosexual conduct; the sentence was stayed pending appeal. Observers noted that no executions from sharia penal code sentences have been carried out since 1999, when sharia penal codes in 12 northern states began being implemented. In April, the presiding judge of the Kano State High Court sentenced president of the Humanist Association of Nigeria Mubarak Bala to 24 years in prison after he pled guilty to 18 counts of insulting religion with the intent to \u201ccause a breach of public peace.\u201d Violence erupted at a publicly sponsored Baptist high school in Kwara State in February when the school refused to allow Muslim students to wear hijabs in school. In June, the Supreme Court ruled in response to a similar 2019 case from Lagos State that the constitution allows Muslim students to wear hijabs in all state-sponsored or affiliated schools. Jewish groups reported discrimination over their observance of the Sabbath on Saturdays and the government\u2019s lack of religious accommodation.\n\nTerrorist groups, including Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa (ISIS-WA), attacked population centers and maintained an ability to stage forces in rural areas and launch attacks against civilian targets across the North East, according to observers. According to media reports, in January and February, ISIS-WA attacked several villages in Borno State, killing at least seven persons, abducting 24 others, and burning churches, mosques, and other buildings. Observers also reported that ISIS-WA efforts to implement shadow governance structures were reduced to the fringes of Lake Chad in the extreme North East. According to the nongovernmental organization (NGO) International Crisis Group, ISIS-WA \u201chas not shied away from cruelly punishing those it sees as contravening its interpretation of Sharia, amputating the hands of alleged thieves and killing adulterers, and on several occasions, it has massacred civilians suspected of supporting the government or in communities that refused to pay taxes or disobeyed orders. It has also been ruthless toward the Christian minority in north-eastern Nigeria, probably partly to demonstrate its loyalty to ISIS.\u201d\n\nAccording to NGOs and press reports, during the year, the level of violence and insecurity increased, including in the predominantly Muslim North West, where expanded numbers of criminal groups carried out thousands of killings, kidnappings, and armed robberies. Because issues of religion, ethnicity, land and resource competition, and criminality are often closely linked, it was difficult to categorize many incidents as targeting individuals because of their religious identity. While much of the violence involved predominantly Muslim herders and, depending on location, either predominantly Christian or Muslim farmers, multiple academic and media sources including the NGO Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) said banditry and other criminality, not animosity between particular religious groups or on the basis of religion, were the primary drivers of intercommunal violence. According to information on its website, ACLED reported 3,953 civilian deaths from violence across the country during the year, compared with 3,699 in 2021, including an increase in violence against Christians, which comprised 5 percent of all violence. ACLED reported that a spike in attacks against Christians that began in previous years continued into 2022, but that overall, Christians were not the primary target of political violence in the country in terms of numbers of incidents. The NGO Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) stated that 32,000 Muslims had been killed over the previous three years because of terrorist attacks in the north of the country and accused Christian groups of \u201cdeceiv[ing] the world by claiming that it is Christians alone who are being killed in Nigeria.\u201d There were instances of mob violence against clergy and members of religious groups and mass killings of Muslims and Christians that press reports and observers described as planned and carried out by organized groups. On June 5, attackers killed an estimated 50 persons, including many children, at the St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, during a Pentecost Sunday service. On September 23, a gang of armed men killed at least 15 persons at a mosque in Zamfara State. In May, a mob overpowered school security and killed a Christian student in Sokoto who had posted a message on social media that some fellow students deemed as intentionally disparaging to religious sensitivities. Mob attackers widely circulated the video of her killing on social media. There were numerous kidnappings, both of clergy and members of religious groups. In separate incidents in September, militants attacked Cherubim and Seraphim churches in Niger and Kaduna States and abducted approximately 120 individuals. In September, gunmen kidnapped dozens of worshippers attending Friday afternoon prayers at a mosque in Zamfara State.\n\nU.S. embassy and consulate general in Lagos officials and visiting U.S. government representatives met with senior government officials and raised issues such as the resolution of widely publicized blasphemy cases, the role of religious leaders in peacebuilding and social trust, reports of societal abuses and discrimination against individuals based on religion, and the role of religious leaders in national elections scheduled for February 2023. These included meetings with senior government officials such as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Presidential Chief of Staff Ibrahim Gambari, cabinet ministers including the Attorney General and Foreign and Interior Ministers, and National Assembly members. The Ambassador and other senior embassy officials regularly met with interfaith and religious groups across the country, including the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Society for the Support of Islam (JNI), the Islamic Society of Removal of Innovation and Reestablishment of the Sunna, and the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council. They met with religious leaders in Kano, Kwara, Edo, Lagos, Imo, Rivers, Anambra, and Enugu States to discuss and encourage efforts to promote peace and religious tolerance in those states. The embassy continued to fund peacebuilding programs in conflict-prone states, such as Kaduna and Plateau, and interfaith dialogue training for leaders in six North West and North Central states. The embassy concluded five small grants to faith-based and community organizations to support reconciliation in communities, primarily in the North Central region, experiencing ethnoreligious violence.",

        "summary": "**The United States has not yet decided whether to recognize the Taliban or any other entity as the Government of Afghanistan or as part of such a government. All references to \u201cthe pre-August 2021 government\u201d refer to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. References to the Taliban in this report do not denote or imply that the United States recognizes the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan. The Taliban did not respond to repeated requests for updates and information on subjects addressed in this report.\n\nAccording to the Taliban, Hanafi jurisprudence is the basis for the legal system, and at present the country does not have in place a clear and cohesive legal framework, judicial system, or enforcement mechanisms. According to the Taliban, laws enacted under the pre-August 2021 government remain in effect unless the laws violate sharia. Taliban leaders largely impose their policies on citizens through guidelines or recommendations specifying acceptable behaviors they justify under their interpretation of sharia and prevalent cultural norms the Taliban consider acceptable.\n\nAccording to UN Special Rapporteur Richard Bennett, the human rights situation in Afghanistan remained deeply concerning, and threats and attacks against Hazara Shia and other Shia Muslims continued, resulting in great loss of civilian life. It was often unclear whether the perpetrators of the threats and violence were members of ISIS-K, local Taliban, or a combination of both. Hazara activists described Taliban repression of Hazaras and the failure of the Taliban to protect them from ISIS-K attacks as part of a trend toward deepened marginalization and the erasure of the Hazara from society. The nongovernmental organization (NGO) Amnesty International (AI) reported that in June, the Taliban conducted a night raid in search of Mohamad Muradi, a Hazara and security official under the pre-August 2021 government, and killed Muradi, six of his men, and two of his daughters. In June, the Taliban released the last of 28 members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community in Kabul whom they had detained in 2021. NGO International Christian Concern said the situation for Christians in the country grew more perilous during the year. Reports and statements quoting Taliban members that they would enforce laws according to sharia engendered fears among Christians and others that the Taliban would treat Christian converts as apostates subject to severe penalties. Reports of Taliban \u201cdoor-to-door\u201d visits to search for Christians also kept Christian converts in deep hiding. After Taliban leader Haibatullah Akundzada announced in November that hudood punishments (those mandated by God for crimes defined by sharia) were non-discretionary, there were reports of floggings for alleged crimes, including theft, \u201cillegitimate\u201d relationships, and violation of social behavior codes. Members of all religious minority groups reported fear of persecution by the Taliban. Minority religious group representatives said the Taliban continued to marginalize and repress members of these groups, including by restricting access to worship, civil service positions, and university admissions. According to Hazara community and NGO representatives, Hazaras, who are predominantly Shia Muslims, continued to face repression, widespread discrimination, and marginalization by the Taliban in public service delivery and public sector hiring. Because religious and ethnic identities are often closely linked, it was difficult to categorize many incidents as being solely based on religious identity. Sikhs and Hindus reported they had ceased to congregate at their places of worship; hundreds had resettled abroad due to fear of violent attacks by the Taliban and ISIS-K and because they could not rely on the Taliban to protect their communities. Civil society groups reported an estimated nine Sikh and Hindu individuals remained in the country at year\u2019s end. While enforcement varied by district and province, local Taliban representatives continued to enforce decrees on gender segregation, women\u2019s dress and head covering, men\u2019s facial hair, unaccompanied women, and music.\n\nAccording to the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), consistent with trends observed in past years, many suicide and improvised explosive device attacks on civilians targeted Shia Muslims, particularly ethnic Hazaras. UNAMA reported a resurgence of these attacks against the Hazara community, for nearly all for which ISIS-K claimed responsibility. UN Special Rapporteur Bennett reported that ISIS-K continued primarily to target civilians of the Shia religious community; in April alone, ISIS-K attacks in Balkh and Kunduz Provinces killed or wounded 100 civilians. In September, a suicide bomber struck an education center in a Hazara area of Kabul. According to UNAMA, the attack killed 53 persons and wounded 110, including mostly girls and women of multiple religious and ethnic backgrounds. Sikhs, Hindus, Christians, and Muslim minority groups again reported that an unquantified number of Sunni Muslims had verbally harassed them. According to international sources, Baha\u2019is and Christians lived in constant fear of exposure and were reluctant to publicly reveal their religious identities. Christian groups reported that public sentiment, as expressed in social media and elsewhere, remained hostile toward converts and to Christian proselytization. They said individuals who converted to or were studying Christianity reported receiving threats, including death threats, from family members. Ahmadiyya Muslims reported they continued to worship only privately and in small groups, at home or in nondescript places of worship, in order to avoid discrimination and persecution.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kabul suspended operations in August 2021. The U.S. government engaged the Taliban throughout the year to urge them to respect the human rights of all the country\u2019s citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs. In July, the Secretary of State announced the launch of the U.S.-Afghan Consultative Mechanism to facilitate closer engagement between U.S. government policymakers and civil society in support of inclusive governance within the country. The U.S. government maintained its sanctions on the Taliban and the Haqqani network, announced actions to impose targeted visa restrictions on human rights abusers, and continued to assist in the relocation of particularly vulnerable members of minority religious groups.\n\nOn November 30, 2022, the Secretary of State redesignated the Taliban as an \u201centity of particular concern,\u201d or EPC, under the International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA) for engaging in particularly severe violations of religious freedom.",

On May 30, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported that five suspected members of the banned Islamic Yakyn Incar religious group were arrested in raids in March and May. Police said that during the raids, they confiscated books, flyers, and computer-data storage devices containing material that promoted the group\u2019s ideology. In its annual report, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses stated that a criminal case against it that followed a government raid on its offices in Bishkek in 2021 remained open. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) reported that the government continued to arrest social media users who circulated or \u201cliked\u201d digital content that the government considered extremist especially religious literature connected to banned groups. The State Commission on Religious Affairs (SCRA) continued to refuse to register Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses congregations in the south of the country, based on a nullified provision of law that formerly required religious groups to register also with local councils, with the most recent denial coming in November. In May, the SCRA denied the importation of a religious text by Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n\nThe government did not always separate those considered violent extremists from inmates incarcerated for lesser crimes, according to NGOs, particularly in women\u2019s prisons. NGOs also said the government did not always provide religious materials to prisoners convicted of affiliation with banned religious groups. In August, following actions that included an intervention from the President\u2019s office, the Bishkek city council rescinded an eviction notice against the country\u2019s only private Jewish school. The notice had generated online harassment and antisemitic comments on social media. According to Christian activists, non-Muslim religious minorities continued to face difficulties arranging for burial of their dead in public cemeteries. An SCRA-proposed solution, which would divide public cemeteries by religion so that all faith groups have burial space, was not implemented at all local levels, according to Christian activists. In a report issued in December, the UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) expressed concerns about the country\u2019s \u201cburdensome registration requirements\u201d for smaller religious minorities and called on the government to \u201cexpedite the adoption\u201d of legislative amendments proposed in 2021 to ease these restrictions. The UNHRC report also expressed concern about \u201cthe excessive censorship of religious materials\u201d imposed by the government, and it called on the government to prevent \u201cdiscrimination on religious grounds\u201d in regulating cemeteries and allocating places for burials.\n\nThere were two reports of societal harassment of minority religions, including community harassment directed against a Christian organization, and online harassment directed towards members of the Jewish community in connection with the Bishkek city council\u2019s efforts to evict the Jewish school from its property.\n\nIn May, following online harassment against the Jewish community in Bishkek, a U.S. embassy officer met with a representative of the Bishkek city council to emphasize the importance of religious tolerance. Embassy officers also raised U.S. concerns about the harassment with senior government officials and coordinated with other foreign missions that raised similar concerns with the government. In August, October, and December, an embassy officer met with representatives from the SCRA to discuss harassment against religious minorities, progress on religious legislation, and the status of government initiatives, including the introduction of religious education in schools and efforts to counter violent extremism. In October, an embassy officer met with Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses representatives, who discussed the group\u2019s ongoing court hearings regarding the pending registration of its congregations in the south of the country. Embassy officers met throughout the year with religious leaders, including representatives of minority religious groups and with representatives of NGOs and civil society groups, to discuss instances of harassment, religious education as a part of civic education, and the rights of religious minorities.",

It also provides for freedom of religion and equal protection under the law regardless of religion and prohibits religious intolerance and \u201cfundamentalism,\u201d which is not defined in law. Religious groups are required to register officially, and registration may be denied to groups deemed morally offensive or subversive. The head of state must take an oath to fulfill duties of the office without consideration of religion.\n\nDuring the year, the government increased its control over territory with assistance from UN forces, bilaterally deployed Rwandan forces, and forces from the Russia-backed Wagner Group. Challenges in consolidating military gains, however, led to continued instability. International and local observers stated that Muslim civilians were disproportionately targeted, and in some instances were killed indiscriminately, by government security and Wagner Group forces during operations in the central and northwestern areas of the country. In January, Wagner Group elements, accompanied by local former militia members mainly from the primarily Christian anti-Balaka armed group recruited by Wagner Group to support security operations, killed at least 30 Muslim civilians in the villages of A\u00efgbado and Yanga.\n\nIn March 2022, the UN high commissioner for human rights expressed concern that the government\u2019s response to armed groups \u201cincreasingly involves arbitrary arrests of members of already vulnerable communities, such as Muslims and Peuls.\u201d Between February and June, the special representative to the UN Secretary-General reported 42 transhumance-related incidents in the west, where Central African Armed Forces (FACA) targeted Fulani herders, who are predominantly Muslim, based on suspected collusion with armed groups. In May, approximately 20 FACA personnel reportedly broke into a Fulani-owned house and killed 10 civilians in Kowon and Nzakoundou, Ouham-Pend\u00e9 Prefecture. The UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) also reported attacks by armed groups in May, resulting in deaths of Christian civilians, and a retaliatory attack on a Muslim community in Ouaka prefecture. In Bangui, MINUSCA reported that FACA elements looted Muslim homes in the PK5 neighborhood, based on religious affiliation and perceived allegiance to armed groups.\n\nDuring the lead up to the April Yaound\u00e9 Declaration, a regional framework for the repatriation and reintegration of the country\u2019s displaced persons, participating powers extensively debated the issue of refugee electoral inclusion but could not reach a consensus on a mechanism to give the country\u2019s displaced citizens ballot access. Because the electoral code does not permit refugees living outside the country to vote, Muslims were underrepresented in the electorate and Muslims \u2013 who make up the majority of the country\u2019s refugees residing in neighboring countries \u2013 could be disenfranchised in local elections in 2023. President Faustin-Archange Touadera, a Christian, set a precedent by attending Islamic prayer services during Eid celebrations in 2021 and continued this practice in 2022. In September, the government announced that Mawlid, the observed birthday of the Prophet Muhammad, will become a public holiday.\n\nThroughout the year, the Russia-backed Wagner Group carried out offensive operations in the country\u2019s north, northwest, east and center-south. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) specializing in interfaith relations said that local perceptions of the Wagner Group had improved and, in many areas, they were no longer perceived as biased in their use of violence, but rather as applying it universally. The NGOs and local media reported that in some predominantly Muslim areas of instability, mainly in the country\u2019s northern frontier zones, residents welcomed Wagner Group efforts, in concert with the local security forces, to reduce banditry.\n\nMuslim community members and leaders reported continued social discrimination, marginalization, difficulty obtaining identification documents, security concerns, and what they described as societal inequality and injustice in many aspects of daily life. At times, traditional and social media outlets carried content that negatively portrayed Muslims as well as Roman Catholics, after the Council of Catholic Bishops refused to support the President\u2019s proposal to redraft the constitution.\n\nInternational and local observers described the violence in the country as continuing along overlapping ethnic and religious lines, with political and economic power struggles as important root causes. Senior Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Muslim leaders continued to promote interfaith dialogue throughout the country. NGOs specialized in reconciliation viewed religion as the solution for interconfessional healing rather than a source of instability.\n\nThe Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officials continued to raise concerns about religious freedom and the safe, voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) to their home communities with the Ministries of Justice, Foreign Affairs, Humanitarian Affairs, and Public Security. Embassy representatives engaged religious leaders on religious freedom and reconciliation and publicly condemned hate speech and violence against religious groups. The Ambassador hosted discussions with religious youth leaders, who shared personal insights on discrimination and intercommunal trust building initiatives, as well as with an interfaith platform focused on reconciliation. Embassy representatives also met with local experts and academics on issues of discrimination pertaining to the practice of traditional religions among Indigenous peoples. The embassy commemorated all the country\u2019s principal religious holidays on social media.\n\nOn November 30, in accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as amended, the Secretary of State placed the Central African Republic on the Special Watch List for having engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom. In addition, the Secretary of State designated the Wagner Group as an Entity of Particular Concern for having engaged in particularly severe violations of religious freedom in the Central African Republic.",

The government\u2019s implementation of a State of Exception in March to address an increase in gang homicides curtailed several constitutional rights and led to the arrest of more than 60,400 citizens, including members of different religious groups. Evangelical Christian pastors working in gang-controlled areas said the State of Exception impacted their congregations and church programs, particularly those working with former gang members. In January, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court reopened the case against several former generals accused of planning the 1989 murders of six Jesuit priests and their housekeeper on the University of Central America campus in San Salvador. In March, a judge ordered the arrest of former President Alfredo Cristiani, who left the country in 2021, because of allegations that he had advance knowledge of the planned murders. Cristiani denied the allegations.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the State of Exception, media outlets reported that gangs restricted access and activities in many neighborhoods and carried out violent attacks and crimes against individuals, regardless of membership in a religious group.

In July, President Alejandro Giammattei established through a government agreement the Presidential Commission on Religious Liberty, appointing as its commissioner Robin Garc\u00eda, an evangelical Christian pastor. According to Garc\u00eda, the commissioner served as a conduit between the President and representatives from a diverse array of registered religious groups.

The government reportedly continued to execute, torture, arrest, and physically abuse individuals for their religious activities. COVID-19 restrictions on travel to and from the country further reduced information about conditions, making details on cases of abuse and estimates involving religious groups difficult to verify.\n\nIn an October 2021 report, the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Korea Future described the government\u2019s denial of religious freedom as absolute and cited multiple incidents of arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and inhuman treatment, and executions of persons because of their religious belief. Officials principally targeted Christians and followers of Shamanism. Of the 244 victims documented in the report, 150 adhered to Shamanism, 91 adhered to Christianity, one to Cheondoism, and one to other beliefs. NGOs and defectors said the government often arrested or otherwise punished family members of Christians. The NGO Open Doors USA (ODUSA) estimated that authorities held 50,000 to 70,000 citizens in prison for being Christian. ODUSA stated that Christians experienced persecution that was \u201cviolent and intense\u201d and that \u201clife for Christians \u2026 is a constant cauldron of pressure; capture or death is only a mistake away.\u201d In an October 2020 white paper, the NGO Database Center for North Korean Human Rights (NKDB) reported 1,411 cases of religious persecution by authorities, including 126 killings and 94 disappearances, based on reports of defectors from the DPRK between 2007 and July 2020 and other sources.\n\nA small number of officially registered religious institutions, including churches, existed in the country, particularly in Pyongyang, although visitors reported that they operated under tight state control and functioned largely as showpieces for foreigners. The government encouraged all citizens to report anyone engaged in unauthorized religious activity or in possession of religious material. There were reports of private Christian religious activity, although the existence of underground churches and the scope of underground religious networks remained difficult to quantify. Defector accounts indicated religious practitioners often concealed their activities from family members, neighbors, coworkers, and others due to fear of being branded as disloyal and concerns their activities would be reported to authorities. Some defectors and NGOs reported unapproved religious materials were available clandestinely. A Korea Future report in July stated that the state ideology of \u201cKimilsungism-Kimjongilism\u201d (adherence to the teachings of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il) had many hallmarks of religion, and the state presents the two leaders as \u201cextraordinary beings\u201d in official materials and authorized texts.\n\nThe U.S. government does not have diplomatic relations with the DPRK. The United States cosponsored a resolution adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly in December that again condemned the country\u2019s \u201clong-standing and ongoing systematic, widespread, and gross violations of human rights\u201d and expressed very serious concern about abuses, including \u201cin some instances summary executions of individuals exercising their freedom of opinion and expression, religion or belief.\u201d The U.S. government raised concerns about religious freedom in the country in other multilateral forums and in bilateral discussions with other governments, particularly those with diplomatic relations with the country.\n\nSince 2001, the DPRK has been designated as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom. On November 30, 2022, the Secretary of State redesignated the country as a CPC and identified the following sanctions that accompanied the designation: the existing ongoing restrictions to which North Korea is subject, pursuant to sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Jackson-Vanik Amendment) pursuant to section 402(c)(5) of the act.",

On the one-year anniversary of October 2021 anti-Hindu communal violence, the government took extra security measures to ensure peaceful celebrations during the Hindu festival of Durga Puja. Minority religious groups claimed the government failed to adequately punish perpetrators of the October 2021 violence. When in July a Muslim crowd attacked a predominantly Hindu community in Narail over a Facebook post supposedly insulting Islam, minority religious groups said that security forces failed to protect Hindu victims. Courts convicted and sentenced to prison two members of the banned Islamist organization Jamaat-ul Mujahideen for attacks on the Shia community in 2015.\n\nIn February, the High Court asked the government to explain how Hindu family inheritance law, which differentiates between men and women in inheritance, was not illegal under the constitution. In June, a High Court judge said women have the constitutional right to wear a burqa or hijab. In its stated effort to prevent militancy and to monitor mosques for \u201cprovocative\u201d messaging, the government continued to provide guidance to imams on the content of their sermons. Minority rights organizations criticized the arbitrary detention of minority community members, often without bail, on what they said were false charges of blasphemy under the Digital Security Act. Members of religious minorities, including Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians, who were sometimes also members of ethnic minorities, continued to say the government was ineffective in preventing communal violence against minority religious communities, and did not protect minorities from forced evictions and land seizures stemming from land disputes.\n\nHindu, Christian, and Buddhist organizations and local human rights groups said communal violence against religious minority communities continued throughout the year. In March, a mob of hundreds of people damaged the wall of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) temple in a property dispute over adjacent land. On January 31, unknown attackers killed a Buddhist monk in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT). In March, women in Dhaka protested against discrimination they experienced for wearing head and face coverings. The nongovernmental organization (NGO) Freedom House and local religious leaders said social media had contributed to an increase in attacks on religious minorities in recent years, as, they said, misinformation frequently went viral and inflamed community tensions against religious minorities. Human rights activists expressed concerns regarding the wellbeing of Hindu and Christian groups in the Muslim-majority refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar. In November, the High Court granted a man bail on the condition that he refrain from spreading any more inflammatory material. The man was previously arrested in 2021 for accusing the Muslim advocacy group Hefazat-e-Islam\u2019s joint general secretary Mamunul Haque of damaging communal harmony.\n\nIn meetings with government officials, civil society members, religious leaders, and in public statements, the Ambassador, other U.S. embassy representatives, and the Ambassador- at-Large, spoke out against acts of violence in the name of religion and urged the government to uphold the rights of minority religious groups and foster a climate of tolerance. During the year, the Ambassador visited Muslim and Hindu places of worship to reinforce the U.S. commitment to religious diversity and interfaith tolerance. In April, the Ambassador at Large for Religious Freedom visited Dhaka and Cox\u2019s Bazar to convey U.S. support for the protection of religious minority communities and to call for better living conditions for Rohingya refugees. In fiscal year 2022, the United States provided over $265 million in humanitarian assistance funding for programs in the country to assist Rohingya refugees (who are overwhelmingly Muslim) from Burma and to assist local host communities.

Despite the requests by the closed churches and the religious associations to which they belong for clemency to resume religious services, the churches remained closed at year\u2019s end. During the year, as in previous years, the government refused to accept new applications for new places of worship, per a ministerial order.

The decree requires this law to be \u201cin accordance with the norms of international law in the field of freedom of conscience and Ukraine\u2019s obligations in connection with joining the Council of Europe.\u201d The President also announced sanctions against senior clergy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) for collaboration with Russia, stating they engaged in wartime collaboration with the invader. Although it continued to be unofficially referred to as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate (or UOC-MP) through year\u2019s end, in May, Church leaders stated it had broken with the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC); a government-commissioned panel of experts, however, concluded the UOC remained connected and subordinate to the ROC. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) searched numerous UOC religious sites based on stated probable cause of collaboration, yielding what the SBU and civil society observers said was significant evidence of collaboration and other illegal acts.\n\nJehovah\u2019s Witnesses continued to report assaults on their followers that went unpunished. In February, the government declared martial law and began general mobilization of reservists. The law does not provide for alternative service during mobilization and martial law. There were some arrests for draft refusal and one case of imprisonment, according to reports, although most conscientious objectors were able to perform alternative service. The autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) said Ukrainian government officials in numerous cases continued to interfere in the decision-making process of Orthodox congregations seeking to leave the UOC by disrupting meetings, preventing registration, and intimidating active parishioners, although they reported fewer incidents by year\u2019s end. Local authorities in Lviv allowed a local developer to complete the construction of a private medical clinic on the grounds of a historic Jewish cemetery despite an August 2020 stop-work order from the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy. According to observers, government investigations and prosecutions of vandalism of religious sites continued to be generally inconclusive, although the government condemned attacks and police arrested perpetrators. Representatives of religious groups continued to report problems with local authorities in allocating land to build religious structures and with national authorities regarding restitution claims. President Zelenskyy made several public statements against antisemitism, participated in Jewish cultural events, and condemned Russian attacks on Jewish sites, including its shelling of a location near the site of the 1941 Babyn Yar massacre.\n\nAccording to numerous sources, Russia\u2019s military forces committed widespread religious freedom abuses in both occupied and Ukrainian government-controlled areas, such as shelling religious institutions and cultural heritage sites and detaining clergy, including physically abusing an Orthodox priest seized from a ship in the Black Sea. Responding to a May attack on a monastery in Donetsk Oblast, President Zelenskyy stated that Russia\u2019s forces knew there were no military targets at the monastery and that approximately 300 lay individuals, including 60 children, were sheltering there.\n\nThe ROC and the UOC continued to label the OCU a \u201cschismatic\u201d group and continued to urge other Orthodox churches not to recognize it. UOC and OCU representatives continued to contest some parish registrations as not reflecting the true will of their congregations. The UOC reported violent threats against some of its congregations. UOC leaders continued to accuse the OCU of seizing churches belonging to the UOC; the OCU responded that parishioners, rather than the OCU, had initiated the transfers of affiliation within the provisions of the law. Church ownership disputes between UOC and OCU members in Zadubrivka village, Chernivtsi Oblast, and some other villages and cities continued. In May, following a UOC Council meeting, the Church announced it disagreed with the position of Patriarch Kirill of the ROC supporting Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and that it took measures making the UOC \u201cfully independent\u201d from the Moscow Patriarchate, measures that the OCU spokesman, the government, and civil society groups said were insufficient and left the UOC still subordinate to the ROC. The independent National Minorities Rights Monitoring Group (NMRMG) reported one documented violent act of antisemitism, compared with three in 2021. There were again reports of vandalism of Christian monuments, Holocaust memorials, synagogues, Jewish cemeteries, and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 kingdom halls.

According to local and international observers, authorities continued to conduct additional scrutiny of some groups and individuals with religious beliefs and practices the government considered \u201cnontraditional\u201d and impose restrictions on their activities. This included some non-Lutheran Protestant Christian groups. The government also restricted use of buildings for religious ceremonies and purposes. Observers reported that the \u201cnotification\u201d procedures established under December 2021 amendments to the Law on Religion simplified the process for holding religious events outside of registered religious buildings but gave government officials the opportunity to deny permission for events, and so continued to function in practice as approval procedures. The government continued to raid religious services and, in some cases, prosecute individuals for \u201cillegal missionary activity.\u201d Some small religious groups reported they had chosen not to attempt registration due to their history of registration denials, their inability to meet the 50-person local registration requirement, or due to fears registration as religious organizations would leave them vulnerable to legal allegations of \u201cpsychological harm\u201d against existing or former community members. Some religious minority groups engaged in ongoing legal processes to attempt to prevent local governments from seizing property based on legal rulings from previous years. Some small, registered, non-violent religious groups faced difficulties in opening bank accounts, possibly due to intentional or accidental inclusion in lists of entities associated with terrorist financing. Other groups, including the Church of Scientology and some Protestant groups, reported improved relations with local government contacts, active government engagement to address cases of religious discrimination by lower-level authorities, and a significant decrease in government-backed, anti-religious propaganda.\n\nIn some cases, schools refused to admit girls wearing religious headscarves. Government representatives cited the constitution and a 2016 decree on school uniforms from the Ministry of Education as prohibiting religious clothing in schools. This led to delays in some girls\u2019 education, as parents sought religious accommodations. Homeschooling for religious reasons was not permitted by law.\n\nAccording to observers and members of minority religious groups, media outlets occasionally issued articles or broadcasts defaming minority religious groups they regarded as \u201cnontraditional,\u201d including Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) said members of some religious groups, including Muslims who chose to wear headscarves or other identifying attire, as well as some Christian groups, including evangelical Protestants, Baptists, and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, continued to face greater societal scrutiny and discrimination.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador and other U.S. embassy officials engaged with the government to urge respect for religious freedom, including by raising specific cases. Embassy representative observed multifaith workshops cosponsored by U.S.-based interfaith NGOs, the MISD, the CRA, and the Association of Religious Organizations of Kazakhstan, which includes many of the Protestant groups deemed \u201cnontraditional\u201d by the government. The embassy also engaged in social media outreach to urge respect for religious freedom.",

Twelve other religious groups have accords granting many of the same benefits in exchange for a degree of government monitoring. Unregistered religious groups operate freely and are eligible for some of the benefits that registered groups receive, but they must apply separately for them.\n\nBetween August 2021 and July, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) expelled 61 persons, mostly due to links with what the ministry stated were violent extremist Islamist groups. Muslim groups, none of which has an accord, continued to experience difficulties acquiring permission from local governments to construct mosques and provide dedicated areas appropriate for Islamic burials. Some local governments granted permission to build mosques or temporary prayer centers and to allow or expand plots for Islamic burials, but according to the Union of Islamic Cultural Communities (UCOI), not enough to meet growing demand. There were again reports of antisemitic incidents, including physical assaults, verbal harassment, discrimination, hate speech, and vandalism. Media reported on antisemitic statements made by some politicians, including denying the right of Israel to exist, denying Israel\u2019s right to self-defense, and saying Ashkenazi Jews had \u201ccontaminated\u201d Israel with \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and \u201cracism.\u201d\n\nThe nongovernmental organization (NGO) Antisemitism Observatory of the Jewish Contemporary Documentation Center Foundation (CDEC) recorded 241 antisemitic acts during the year, compared with 220 in 2021 and 224 in 2020. Of the incidents, at least 164 involved hate speech on social media or the internet, compared with 117 incidents in 2021. Press reported examples of antisemitic graffiti and posters, including depictions of swastikas on walls, antisemitic stereotypes, and praise of neo-Nazi groups in cities such as Rome, Milan, and Busto Arsizio. Experts monitoring antisemitism said they believed the number of antisemitic incidents was vastly underreported. The independent NGO Vox Diritti reported that in its monitoring of social media, between January and October, 854 tweets mentioning Islam contained negative messages against Muslims.\n\nRepresentatives of the U.S. embassy and consulates general met throughout the year with national and local government officials to encourage respect for religious freedom and equal treatment for all faiths. They also discussed efforts to integrate new migrants \u2013 many of whom were Muslim, Orthodox, or Hindu \u2013 and second-generation migrants living in the country. Embassy officials additionally expressed support for a proposed accord between the government and the country\u2019s Muslim communities. U.S. government officials met with religious leaders and civil society representatives to promote interfaith dialogue and awareness, to encourage religious groups to be more effective in interfaith outreach. On March 7, the director of the Office of International Religious Freedom and embassy officials met with National Coordinator for the Fight Against Antisemitism Milena Santerini and representatives of the Jewish community to discuss how to support their efforts to counter antisemitism and promote interfaith dialogue. The embassy and consulates continued to utilize social media platforms to acknowledge major Christian, Muslim, and Jewish holidays, as well as to amplify initiatives that promote religious freedom and interfaith dialogue on the ground.",

Following the 2020 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, the transition government adopted the Transition Charter in September 2020, which recognized the continued validity of the 1992 constitution\u2019s definition of the country as secular and continued to prohibit religious discrimination under the law. Following the May 2021 consolidation of military power, the subsequent transition government also upheld the validity of these founding documents. The law criminalizes abuses against religious freedom.\n\nThe transition government drafted a bill governing religious freedom and the exercise of worship; it was adopted as a draft law by the Council of Ministers in December 2021. The request for full adoption and implementation of the law was pending with the transition government as of the end of the year. This law would enable the Ministry of Religious Affairs, Worship, and Customs (MARCC) more easily to oversee religious organizations by having a primary role in adjudicating their registration with the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization (MATD). Civil society organizations continued to report that the transition government and security forces struggled to tamp down the violence generated by extremist groups, including those with stated religious ideologies. The MARCC organized pilgrimages for Catholics, Protestants, and Muslims throughout the year. The High Islamic Council (HCI) organized conferences and workshops on countering violent extremism and regulating preaching with the support of the MARCC. The MARCC also renewed a training program for imams with the Moroccan government. The Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission held its fifth public hearing in June, having heard a total of 32,300 individuals since its launch in 2014, including cases involving religious freedom violations.\n\nIndividuals affiliated with terrorist organizations, including those organizations designated as such by the U.S. government, used violence and launched attacks on civilians, security forces, peacekeepers, and others perceived as not adhering to the terrorists\u2019 interpretation of Islam. Particularly in the center of the country, the al-Qa\u2019ida-affiliated Jama\u2019at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) attacked multiple towns in the Mopti and Segou regions and threatened Christian, Muslim, and traditional religious communities. Groups identified by authorities as extremist organizations targeted and closed government schools for their perceived \u201cWestern\u201d curriculum and ordered the transformation of some of them into Quranic schools. In the regions of Mopti and Segou, groups identified as extremists reportedly continued observing verbal \u201cpeace\u201d agreements previously entered into with local populations, with stipulations that permitted the local population to move freely throughout the area and practice their faith within prescribed limits in exchange for not challenging the groups\u2019 territorial claims.\n\nThe Cadre for Action, Monitoring, Mediation, and Negotiation of Religious Denominations and Civil Society, an interfaith mediation network, advocated for peace and security in the country. Muslim religious leaders continued to condemn what they termed extremist interpretations of sharia, while non-Muslim religious leaders condemned what they characterized as extremism related to religion. Some Christian missionaries again expressed concern regarding the increased influence in remote areas of organizations they characterized as violent and extremist. Representatives of the Catholic organization Caritas stated such extremist groups forced women of all faiths to wear veils in some parts of the region of Mopti. Caritas characterized these developments as signs of the growing influence of extremist interpretations of Islam in Mopti, which they believed threatened the Christian community. Members of the Shia community continued to face discrimination from followers of different schools of Islam. Members of religious groups commonly attended the religious ceremonies of other religious groups. Muslim, Protestant, and Catholic leaders jointly called for peace and solidarity among all faiths on religious holidays.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador and embassy officials discussed with transition government officials, religious leaders, and human rights organizations the importance and long-held tradition of interfaith dialogue as a tool to bring peace to the country. They underscored to these leaders their important role in promoting religious tolerance and freedom. The embassy supported programs to counter violent extremism related to religion and to address conflict and radicalization among vulnerable communities. The embassy met regularly with transition government officials charged with religious affairs and with representatives from religious minority associations operating in the country. In April, to commemorate the beginning of Ramadan, the Ambassador met with influential imams and women religious leaders in Bamako, highlighting the role of religious leaders in confronting religious intolerance and promoting peace and released a statement on the important role religious leaders play in society.",

Reports of the slow pace of restitution of confiscated properties continued, especially to the Greek Catholic Church and the Jewish community. In January, Calin Georgescu, honorary chair of the political party Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, praised Ion Antonescu, the country\u2019s dictator during the Holocaust, and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the founder and leader of the Legionnaire Movement, an organization that adopted antisemitic legislation and carried out various antisemitic attacks, including a pogrom in Bucharest in 1941. In March, a Bucharest court revoked the deferred prison sentence against former intelligence officer Vasile Zarnescu, previously found guilty of Holocaust denial, and instead issued him a warning. In February, Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca established an interministerial committee for monitoring the implementation of the two-year national strategy to combat antisemitism, xenophobia, radicalization, and hate speech, which the government adopted in 2021.\n\nSome minority religious groups, including the Greek Catholic Church and the Seventh-day Adventist Church, continued to report Romanian Orthodox priests and adherents at times blocked their access to cemeteries. Material promoting antisemitic views, glorifying the Legionnaire Movement, an antisemitic group founded in 1927 and also known as the Legion of the Archangel Michael, and promoting Holocaust denial and relativism, continued to appear on the internet. Media outlets reported that during a wreath-laying ceremony at the Holocaust Memorial in Bucharest in January, two persons attempted to lay a wreath with a message denying the Holocaust, and officials opened an investigation. According to a study released by the Wiesel Institute in July, articles published online continued to state that Jews or Israel were responsible for manufacturing harmful COVID-19 vaccines and were profiting from the health crisis. Its survey results issued in 2021 found 22 percent of respondents agreed with a statement that Jews act to destabilize society while 64 percent of respondents disagreed.\n\nU.S. embassy officials continued to advocate with the government for restitution of religious property to the original owner, and religious tolerance. The embassy emphasized respect for religious freedom and paid tribute to Holocaust victims through Facebook postings. Embassy officials met with ROC leaders and with representatives of the Jewish and Islamic communities to discuss ways to promote religious freedom and interfaith dialogue.",

COVID-19 health restrictions were in place until late September, and most religious leaders commented these restrictions continued to negatively affect their organizations. Media outlets reported backlash from some religious groups to a survey administered by the Ministry of Education and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) that asked 10- to 12-year-old children about sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Religious leaders called the questions \u201cinappropriate\u201d and termed the survey a \u201cpossible abuse\u201d of children. According to politicians, the rejection of the survey created a political climate that limited opportunities to discuss the legalization of same-sex civil unions or marriage during the year.

The ruling established a precedent nationwide that pro-BDS resolutions are illegal. The Supreme Court of the region of Murcia ruled in February that the local government violated the right to freedom of religion in failing to provide Islamic studies courses in schools; the regional education ministry began providing these courses later in the year. A nongovernmental organization (NGO) stated 90 percent of Muslim students in the country were unable to access Islamic studies classes. Multiple human rights NGOs stated that the part of the penal code that criminalizes offending \u201creligious sentiments\u201d unduly restricted freedom of expression.

Thirteen of 28 states have laws restricting religious conversions for all faiths. Some of these states also impose penalties specifically against forced religious conversions for the purpose of marriage although historically, some state high courts have dismissed cases brought under these laws.\n\nThere were numerous reports during the year of violence by law enforcement authorities against members of religious minorities in multiple states, including plainclothes police in Gujarat publicly flogging four Muslim men accused of injuring Hindu worshippers during a festival in October, and the Madhya Pradesh State government bulldozing Muslim-owned homes and shops following communal violence in Khargone in April.

In August, there were reports that police arrested Shiite Muslims in Srinagar, Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, for marching in a procession without a permit to mark the Muslim month of Muharram. The government, citing security reasons, had not allowed such processions for the previous 25 years. Police also arrested Muslims in Dulhepur village, Uttar Pradesh State, for meeting at a house for congregational prayer. Haryana and Karnataka States passed anticonversion laws and began enforcing them against non-Hindus. Himachal Pradesh State also passed an anticonversion law, which Christians challenged in that state\u2019s high court. In October, the Supreme Court failed to reach agreement in a review of a Karnataka High Court ruling that upheld a Karnataka government ban on religious garb in educational institutions, including wearing hijabs in an all-girls\u2019 school in that state.

The Supreme Court referred the matter to a larger bench, which had not yet given its ruling at the end of the year.\n\nOn April 26, 108 former senior government officials wrote Prime Minister Narendra Modi stating that government discrimination against religious minorities, \u201cparticularly Muslims, in states like Assam, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand,\u201d was \u201cundermining\u201d the country\u2019s constitution. In its annual report, the NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the government \u201ccontinued its systematic discrimination and stigmatization of religious and other minorities, particularly Muslims.\u201d In June, several parts of the country reported violent protests and acts of arson after spokespersons Nupur Sharma and Naveen Jindal from the country\u2019s ruling Bharativa Janata Party (BJP) party made televised remarks about the Prophet Muhammad which were widely seen as offensive by Muslims. Muslims killed two Hindus they said supported the remarks, posting a video of one victim being decapitated in Udaipur, a city in the western state of Rajasthan. The BJP suspended Sharma, who was charged with hurting religious sentiment, expelled Jindal, and issued a statement which said it \u201crespects all religions\u201d and \u201cis strongly against any ideology which insults or demeans any sect or religion.\u201d The Ministry of External Affairs noted Sharma\u2019s comments did not reflect the views of the Indian government. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and government officials from 11 countries condemned the remarks.\n\nAttacks on members of religious minority communities, including killings, assaults, and intimidation, occurred in various states throughout the year. These included incidents of \u201ccow vigilantism\u201d against non-Hindus based on allegations of cow slaughter or trade in beef and incidents in which Muslim men were alleged to have married Hindu women to convert them.

By November 26, the NGO United Christian Forum (UCF) said there had been 511 anti-Christian incidents around the country reported to its hotline, compared to 505 in all of 2021, and urged the government to take action in response to these incidents. Most of the incidents were reported in four states: Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Tamil Nadu. On April 6, the Federation of Indian American Christian Organizations of North America released its 2022 annual report and documented 761 violent incidents against Christians in the country in 2021, including neighborhood skirmishes, targeted killings, and armed assaults. In January, members of a religious civil society group wrote the president of the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of India to ask that organization to take stronger action with the government to protect Christians in the country. In its letter, the group also said, \u201cThe violent acts against the Christian community and Muslim community or any other minority group are in complete violation of the law of the land and the Indian Constitution.\u201d In August, the spokesperson of the Christian NGO Open Doors UK & Ireland said the situation facing Christians and other religious minorities in the country was \u201cunprecedentedly grave.\u201d In September, the Supreme Court directed the Ministry of Home Affairs to collect information from eight states within four months on allegations of attacks against Christians. Terrorist groups Lashkar-e-Taiyaaba and Hizbul Mujahideen killed several civilians and migrant laborers belonging to the minority Hindu and Sikh communities in Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir during the year, a slight decrease from the previous year. The South Asian Terrorism Portal said 30 civilians and 30 members of the security forces were killed in 151 incidents in Jammu and Kashmir during the year. The killings forced a number of Hindu families to leave for Hindu-majority districts in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThere were also cases of communal violence between religious groups. The National Crimes Record Bureau reported 378 instances of communal violence in 2021 (most recent data) compared to 857 in 2020. Religious leaders, academics, political figures, and activists made inflammatory public remarks about religious minorities.

In February, Prime Minister John Brice\u00f1o attended the opening of the new Ahmadiyya Muslim Noor Mosque in Belize City and stated the group \u201chas played a positively influential role in the lives of many \u2026 to build a brotherhood and a community\u201d in the country.\u201d In November, the government officially launched the People\u2019s Constitutional Commission, which includes a principal commissioner representing the BCC and an alternate representing the Belize Association of Evangelical Churches (BAEC).\n\nIn June, the father of a five-year-old boy said two private primary schools had discriminated against his child because the schools refused to admit the child unless he cut off his dreadlocks, a hairstyle that was in accordance with Rastafarian beliefs. Religious groups continued collaboration with international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and religious affiliates, including local churches and civil society organizations, to support nationwide missionary work.\n\nU.S. embassy officials, including the Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires, reiterated the importance of religious tolerance in discussions with government officials, including the prime minister, minister of foreign affairs, and opposition representatives, and they encouraged the government to engage with a wide spectrum of religious groups. The embassy used social media to highlight the importance of religious freedom and respect for religious diversity.",

        "summary": "The constitution declares the state is secular and guarantees freedom of religion, equal rights irrespective of religious belief, and the right to worship and profess one\u2019s religion. The law states government officials may prohibit the activity of a religious association for violating public order or engaging in \u201cextremist activity.\u201d The law allows the government to criminalize a broad spectrum of activities as extremist but does not precisely define extremism. A law enacted in July to counter \u201cextremist activities\u201d authorizes creation of a database of materials defined as extremist and a \u201cunified register\u201d of individuals in organizations defined as terrorist or extremist. The law identifies Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism as the country\u2019s four \u201ctraditional\u201d religions and recognizes the special role of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC).\n\nReligious groups and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) reported authorities continued to investigate, detain, imprison, torture, physically abuse persons, and seize their property because of their religious belief or affiliation or membership in groups designated \u201cextremist,\u201d \u201cterrorist,\u201d or \u201cundesirable,\u201d including Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatars, Hizb ut-Tahrir, Tablighi Jamaat, followers of Turkish Muslim theologian Said Nursi, the Church of Scientology, Falun Gong, and multiple evangelical Protestant groups. In one example, an NGO reported that in July, a court in Kemerovo upheld a seven-year prison term in a labor camp for a disabled member of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses for organizing the activities of an extremist organization. According to the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses annual report for the period September 2021 through August 2022, there were 93 criminal convictions, mostly in cases brought in previous years, as well as 39 new cases involving 101 defendants. The report stated that 60 individuals were in pretrial detention and cited six cases of police torture and 239 home searches conducted in 52 locations. During the year, courts sentenced numerous Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to lengthy prison terms on charges of participating in an extremist organization and convicted many of conducting or participating in religious services. Members of Hizb ut-Tahrir received lengthy prison sentences, and authorities undertook prosecutions of followers of Said Nursi. During the year, ROC priests and members of other religious communities were fined or banned from continuing in their religious duties for \u201cdiscrediting the Russian armed forces\u201d after making comments critical of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine while ROC Patriarch Kirill expressed support of government actions. At a May press conference, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov compared Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, to Hitler and accused Jews of antisemitism. In August, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) opened judicial proceedings against the Jewish Agency for Israel in Moscow for allegedly violating data privacy laws. The government opened criminal cases against members of smaller religious groups for what it called illegal missionary work and the distribution of extremist materials. The government continued to grant privileges to the ROC not accorded to other religious groups.\n\nThere were reports of societal violence and vandalism with antisemitic overtones, as well as increasing reports of openly antisemitic rhetoric entering the country\u2019s mainstream media. On March 1, the former editor of a prominent Moscow radio station, who is Jewish, found a pig\u2019s head and a Ukrainian coat of arms sticker with antisemitic statements written on it outside his Moscow apartment. On September 26, a gunman with a swastika on his shirt killed 17 persons, including 11 children, and wounded 24 at a school in Izhevsk. The SOVA Center, a Moscow-based NGO, reported several incidents of vandalism at Jewish religious sites as well as other incidents of religiously motivated vandalism.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador and U.S. embassy representatives advocated greater religious freedom in the country, highlighting the government\u2019s misuse of the law on extremism to restrict the peaceful activities of religious minorities. The embassy also used social media to disseminate messages advocating religious freedom. In recent years, the government has expelled U.S. diplomats and prohibited the embassy from employing Russian and third-country nationals. In addition, the Russian government engaged in extreme repression of civil society and dramatically curtailed freedom of expression following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has sought to stigmatize and criminalize interactions between its nationals and foreign governments. For these reasons, the embassy\u2019s outreach to the religious community was constrained. Department of State officials continued to monitor the situation of U.S. citizens working with religious institutions and organizations in the country to determine whether authorities were improperly targeting them for their faith or religious work.\n\nOn November 30, 2022, in accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as amended, the Secretary of State redesignated Russia a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in and tolerating systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom and identified the following sanctions that accompanied the designation: the existing ongoing sanctions issued for individuals identified pursuant to section 404(a)(2) of the Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 and section 11 of the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014, as amended by Section 228 of the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, pursuant to section 402(c)(5) of the act.",

The federal government does not require religious groups to register, but some registered groups may receive tax-exempt status.\n\nA Quebec provincial law on secularism prohibits certain provincial government employees from wearing religious symbols when publicly exercising their official functions. In May, the Supreme Court ruled Alexandre Bissonnette, who killed six worshippers at the Grand Mosque in Quebec City in 2017, would be eligible for parole after serving 25 years of his life sentence, rejecting the Crown prosecutor\u2019s appeal to impose a 50-year wait for parole eligibility. Provincial governments continued to impose COVID-related restrictions on assembly, including for all faith groups, through the end of April. While the provincial orders were in place, religious communities continued to criticize the measures limiting religious gatherings for being discriminatory, given that mass gatherings for sports events and other functions were permitted. In May, an Alberta provincial court found Church in the Vine Pastor Tracy Fortin guilty of obstructing an Alberta health inspector\u2019s attempt to verify if the church was enforcing COVID-19 masking and social distancing rules. In July, an Alberta provincial court ordered Fortin to pay a fine and a victim surcharge; in October a higher Alberta court dismissed Fortin\u2019s appeal.\n\nIn January, the Ontario government announced it would partner with the Center for Israel and Jewish Affairs and the Friends of the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies as part of the province\u2019s plan to fight racism, hate, and prejudice in schools. In June, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigated the arrest of two Sikh men by Ottawa police on Parliament Hill on June 11. Police sources said they received a tip, subsequently proven false, that members of an extremist group were headed to a protest with explosives. Police arrested and questioned the men, who were organizers of a peaceful protest by Members of the United Front of Sikh Canadians; police subsequently released them without charge. In September and October, the provincial governments of Alberta and Manitoba adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, becoming the fourth and fifth provinces to formally adopt or endorse the IHRA standard.\n\nReports continued of anti-Muslim and antisemitic incidents, including cases of violence, hate speech, harassment, discrimination, and vandalism. In July, Statistics Canada reported 884 incidents of police-reported, religiously motivated hate crimes in 2021, a 67 percent increase from 2020. According to the B\u2019nai Brith Canada League for Human Rights, there was a 7.2 percent increase in antisemitic incidents in 2021, compared with 2020. The league recorded 2,799 reports of antisemitic incidents in 2021, compared with 2,610 in 2020. B\u2019nai Brith Canada said online hate had become the preferred method of targeting Jews; it recorded 2,093 incidents of online hate in 2021 compared with 1,863 cases in 2020. During the year, authorities continued to detain Nathaniel Veltman, pending trial for killing four members of a Muslim family and injuring a fifth in a vehicle attack in London, Ontario, in June 2021. Police said they believed the defendant targeted victims because they were Muslim. Charges against Veltman included four counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder, and associated terrorism charges. In January, Jeffrey Ryan Hill attacked a Muslim woman who was sitting in her vehicle with her children at the al-Ameen Mosque in Edmonton, Alberta; police arrested and charged Hill with mischief and uttering threats. He was sentenced to 90 days in prison. In May, police arrested Uber Eats delivery man Kyle McLeod for a suspected hate crime committed outside a Jewish school in Toronto. According to media sources McLeod assaulted a school staff member and used antisemitic invectives. In March, Vancouver police arrested and charged Yuniar Kurniawan with one count of mischief for the August 2021 vandalism of a Vancouver, British Columbia, memorial to 376 Sikh, Muslim, and Hindu passengers on the ship Komagata Maru who were denied entry to the country in 1914 and forced to return to India; the court case continued through year\u2019s end. According to the group Descendants of the Komagata Maru Society, the incident resonated with Indo-Canadians as a reminder of historic prejudice directed against South Asian immigrants on racial and religious grounds.\n\nIn July, Pope Francis traveled to the country and issued an apology to its Indigenous peoples for the \u201cthe evil\u201d committed in the former residential school system administered by the Catholic and other churches. Prime Minister Trudeau stated Pope Francis\u2019s visit had an \u201cenormous impact\u201d on survivors, although it was only a first step, and reconciliation will continue to be the shared responsibility of all Canadians.\n\nU.S. embassy, consulate general, and other U.S. government officials emphasized the need for respect for religious freedom and diversity with national and provincial governments. They likewise reaffirmed the U.S. government commitment to addressing discrimination and exclusion through the 2021 U.S.-Canada Roadmap for a Renewed Partnership. The Roadmap is a strategic document of shared policy priorities. Embassy and other U.S. government officials met with representatives from Global Affairs Canada\u2019s Office of Diversity and Inclusion to discuss issues of religious freedom in the country, including religious expression, inclusion, and respect for religious diversity. Throughout the year, the embassy and consulates general used social media to amplify religious freedom messaging from senior Department of State officials. In January, the Ambassador marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day at the National Holocaust Memorial in Ottawa alongside the mayor of Ottawa, members of the diplomatic community, and leaders of the Jewish community. As part of the national #WeRemember commemoration, the embassy building was one of many buildings and monuments across the country that lit its lights in yellow to mark the day. In December, the Ambassador participated in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Company\u2019s program The House to underscore the U.S. government\u2019s commitment to fighting antisemitism.",

        "summary": "The constitution provides citizens with \u201cthe right and freedom to believe or not to believe in religion.\u201d The government officially recognizes four religions: Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and the Baha\u2019i Faith, with Buddhism paramount. Decree 315, rather than law, sets forth rules for religious practice and minimum land requirements for building houses of worship and defines the government as the final arbiter of permissible religious activities.\n\nReligious leaders continued to state that while authorities in urban areas and in some districts had a strong understanding of laws governing religious activities, improper restrictions on religious freedom remained prevalent in rural areas. Reports continued of local authorities, especially in isolated villages, discriminating against and sometimes expelling followers of minority religious groups, particularly Christians, for refusing to renounce their faith. Media outlets reported Christian convert and Lao Evangelical Church (LEC) Pastor Sy Sengmanee was found badly beaten and dead on October 23, several days after a villager witnessed his abduction in Khammouane Province. In March, authorities pressured a Christian family to take down social media posts in which they described experiencing violence in their Buddhist-majority village for practicing \u201ca foreign religion\u201d and criticized the village chief for his role in the violence. No new groups successfully registered with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA). While some unregistered groups said they could practice without interference in house churches, others said local authorities in many areas considered group worship in homes illegal.\n\nReligious leaders continued to state that Decree 315 established onerous requirements sometimes used to restrict travel for religious purposes. Christian groups said burdensome property requirements hindered construction or renovation of houses of worship in some areas. In August, the government approved construction of a Seventh-day Adventist church in Champasak Province, despite the group\u2019s owning land there that was smaller than the legal minimum requirement. Members of minority religions continued to conceal their religious affiliation in order to join and avoid discrimination in the ruling Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party (LPRP), the government, and the military. Authorities stated some local officials did not apply Decree 315 correctly and that the government continued to train provincial officials to implement Decree 315 and other laws governing religion. They said, however, that conducting training in remote areas was difficult.\n\nAccording to government and religious group sources, tensions continued in rural areas among animists, Buddhists, and growing Christian communities. Religious leaders said there were reports that villagers threatened to expel Christians from their villages if they did not renounce their faith. Reports continued of villagers preventing the burial of Christians in public cemeteries.\n\nU.S. embassy officials regularly raised specific religious freedom cases and issues regarding cumbersome regulations, including registration procedures, with the government and LPRP officials and continued to encourage the use of open dialogue and conflict resolution to settle them. In official meetings, the Ambassador promoted religious freedom as a universal basic human right and offered U.S. support to the government as it began the process of codifying the provisions of Decree 315 into law. Embassy officials regularly met with leaders from a wide variety of religious groups and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to understand better the problems faced by members of minority religious groups.",
